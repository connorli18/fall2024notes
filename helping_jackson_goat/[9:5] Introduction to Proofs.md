# Introduction to Proofs

#### Why should we care?

This class is generally about <u>group theory</u>. You can think about groups as a collection of abstract items (like a bucket that contains a bunch of random math stuff and symbols). These are really useful because they help us generate proofs for more complex problems.

The reason why is because groups and sets have very interesting properties (which we can show/prove that they exist), and then we can use these properties to find some very nice results when we apply them to things that we are actually interested in. Hopefully, it's a way to turn hard problems into something more conceptually basic.

So, let's define some of these "basic concepts".

#### What is a Set?
