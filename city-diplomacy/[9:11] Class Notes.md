### Class Notes

#### Peace of Westphalia

- End of an era for International Relations $\rightarrow$ the nation-state becomes the main actor of international relations (change from previous)
  - Before, it was emperor, popes, kings, barons, and even cities etc. $\rightarrow$ these layers all contributed to international relations
    - Some story about a Venice ambassador is sitting on a cape of gold powder to negogiate with the king of France
- Ghent (1913) $\rightarrow$ mayor of Ghent wanted to invite the mayors of the world (city was also hosting the universal World Exposition)
  - Hope to build collaboration via the International Union of Cities (created in Ghent) $\rightarrow$ International Union of Local Authorities (new name)
  - Wanted to also share "how to design a city" for the people that were creating cities!
- Cold War: Rise of City Diplomacy (post WWII $\rightarrow$ city diplomacy was divided into 2 groups but also further divided with communist vs liberal)
  - The first twinning agreements were between British cities and German cities, British people wanted to help poor German towns (Coventry + Dresden)
  - US cities signed twinning agreements with Soviet cities as well (cooperations)
  - Twinning agreements: national governments are involved based on decentralization & democracy
    - US federal can also limit city diplomacy if cities create responsbility for national government (centralized governments probably send twinning agreements from US ministry affairs)
  - "Municipal Foreign Policy": This was the term preferred in the Cold War (peace and disarmament is a big concern)
    - An example is a nuclear-free city!
    - Another example is South Africa apartheid, boycotting companies linked to the regime
    - Another example is the protection of undocumented migrants - "sanctuary cities"

#### Four Stages of City Diplomacy

- (1910s onwards) Solidarity
- (1990s onward) Economic development
- (2015 onward) Partnerships
- (2020s onwards) Multilevel Governance

#### (Economic) Globalization

- What is (economic) globalization: the wide spread of goods, information, technology, etc.
  - A lot of cities suffer from the deconstruction and dispersal of the production system 
    - [London] Smog from the Chimney Smoke
    - [Detroit] Used to be the car capital of the world, but then more competitors + decentralization made this bad economically 
    - [Leeds, Manchester] Northern industrial cities
    - [Lille] Big industrial city that suffered from this, economic suffering $\rightarrow$ leads to population drop
  - Cities are now part of dispersed economic activities (now, lots of companies are headquartered in these cities) 
- Most successful cities seem to "drain resources" from the other cities!
  - You can see this by "medical deserts" if you look at hospital densities around big cities
  - Cities compete for assets $\rightarrow$ "students", (example of towns in France offering a lot to Sciences Po)
- Impact of COVID-19 & International Conflicts
  - COVID-19: Relocalization of stuff (post-dispersal) $\rightarrow$ this is more of a Republican thing, but it's making sure that, in lockdown, you still have everything you need
  - Invasion of Ukraine by Russia $\rightarrow$ this goes against the values of city diplomacy (you have mayors advocating for the war against/bombing of Russia)
    - 70% of refugees concentrate in cities (urban policy topic is immigration/refugee acceptance)

#### Urbanization

- Now, 55% of the population (4B+) lives in Urban Areas today! Back in 1950, only 1/3 of the world population lived in cities (746M) $\rightarrow$ 2/3 of humanity is expected to live in urban areas by 2050
- Lagos, Nigeria is getting really big!
