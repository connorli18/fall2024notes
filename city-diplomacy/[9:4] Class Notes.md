### City Diplomacy

#### Definitions

- **City**

  - Notes
    - A place where people live that is larger or more important than a town (an area where many people live and work)
    - Rural $\rightarrow$ urban space transition, most of people now live in cities and we have turned into a worldwide urban phenomenon!
    - It is more than a space, it is about "the people that live there"
    - It is also about the "government of a city"
  - Three thing (Place, People, Government) define a city
    - Place $\rightarrow$ "urb" (Latin root)
    - People $\rightarrow$ "Civitas" (Latin)
    - Government $\rightarrow$ "Polis" (Greek)
  - What does it mean when the "C" in "City" is capitalized?
    - "City" is a borough of London (became the financial district)
    - Financial district, we refer to as "the City"

- **City Governance**

  - General Layout, may not always be true and could be far more complex!
    - <u>Elected Bodies</u>: Mayor, City Council
    - <u>Appointed Bodies</u>: Deputy Mayor (Ministers), Mayoral Cabinet, Members, Head/Officials of Departments
      - There is uncertainty regarding these positions, governing party could change and you might lose your appointments/jobs
    - <u>Permanent Staff</u>

- **City's Management of International Relations**

  - Key role of the mayor
    - They use their weight to prioritize city diplomacy $\rightarrow$ if it is prioritized, then they will not be diplomats, since it requires support from the person in office!

  - IR can be managed by the mayor's cabinet, deputy mayor's cabinet, IR department, (+) some role of the economic development agency (if present)
    - IR can often be part of the cabinet of the mayor (it can be more centralized depending on the priorities of the mayor)
