### Introduction to City Diplomacy

#### Definitions

- **City**

  - Notes
    - A place where people live that is larger or more important than a town (an area where many people live and work)
    - Rural $\rightarrow$ urban space transition, most of people now live in cities and we have turned into a worldwide urban phenomenon!
    - It is more than a space, it is about "the people that live there"
    - It is also about the "government of a city"
  - Three thing (Place, People, Government) define a city
    - Place $\rightarrow$ "urb" (Latin root)
    - People $\rightarrow$ "Civitas" (Latin)
    - Government $\rightarrow$ "Polis" (Greek)
  - What does it mean when the "C" in "City" is capitalized?
    - "City" is a borough of London (became the financial district)
    - Financial district, we refer to as "the City"

- **City Governance**

  - General Layout, may not always be true and could be far more complex!
    - <u>Elected Bodies</u>: Mayor, City Council
    - <u>Appointed Bodies</u>: Deputy Mayor (Ministers), Mayoral Cabinet, Members, Head/Officials of Departments
      - There is uncertainty regarding these positions, governing party could change and you might lose your appointments/jobs
    - <u>Permanent Staff</u>

- **City's Management of International Relations **(focused on Milan)

  - Key role of the mayor
    - They use their weight to prioritize city diplomacy $\rightarrow$ if it is prioritized, then they will not be diplomats, since it requires support from the person in office!

  - IR can be managed by the mayor's cabinet, deputy mayor's cabinet, IR department, (+) some role of the economic development agency (if present)
    - IR can often be part of the cabinet of the mayor (it can be more centralized depending on the priorities of the mayor)
    - Economic development agency could be a public-private entity (political direction is aligned with other qualities of the city)

- **Global Cities**: Connect it with the rest of the world

  - 3 Main Features: Demography, Domestic Political and Economic Role, Impact on World Affairs
    - <u>Demography</u>: has to be a big city! Probably >1m citizens
    - <u>Domestic Political and Economics Role</u>: Creator of economic and political policy
    - <u>Impact on World Affairs</u>: It must play an active role in world affairs
  - "Highly concentrated command points in the organizaiton of the world economy [...] key locations for finance and for specailized services firms [...] sites of production, including the production of innvations [...] markets for the products and innovations produced"
  - "Strategic hinges of globalization [...] the macro-dynamics of globalization and urganization can, in practice, be anchored to an entity such as the global city, which stands in the very midset of them as both their subject and their engine"

- **Metropolis:** Means a really big city, rooted in "Mother City" from Greek

  - Definitions
    - <u>UCLG</u>: Agglomerations with a demographic threshold of 1 million inhabitants
    - <u>OECD</u>: An area outside the core city is part of a metroplitan area if more than 15% of its employed residents commute into the city
    - Other Terms:
      - <u>Megacities</u>: 10M+ Inhabitants
        - This is usually just one city, though!
      - <u>Meta-Cities</u> / <u>Megaregions</u>: 20M+ Inhabitants
        - This could be multiple cities, "urbanist corridor" including DC, NYC, etc.
  - Administrative definitions are important, because a lot of people might contribute to taxation stuff, but their home-towns may never receive the taxes from which they work

- **Intermediary Cities**: Confusion about the way cities are classified in national and global contexts!

  - Definition
    - <u>UCLG</u>: Cities with a population of between 50,000 and 1 million people that generally play a primary role in connecting important rural and urban areas to basic facilities and services
  - I-Cities host 20% of the human population, almost 9k I-cities across the world
  - Use census specific things to find city-population

- **City Networks:** Connections between cities, have grown exponentially in numbers and membership

  - <u>Definition</u>: Formalised organizations whose main membership is local governments
  - <u>Different Levels</u>: National, regional, global
  - <u>Scope</u>: Ad-hoc/generalist
  - 2 Main Goals:
    - Developing local policies, exchanging best practices or joint pilot projects
    - Lobbying national governments and international organizations
  - They have a growing role in global governance, particular in the environmental sector
  - Examples: UCLG, C40, ICLEI, Eurocities, AIMF, Mayors for Peace, MUFFP, etc.

- **City Diplomacy:** "A set of processes by which cities engage in relations with actors on an international political stage with the aim of representing themselves and their interests"

  - Actions
    - Bilateral
    - Multilateral
  - Impact: Cities are reshaping international relations!

#### Focus on City Diplomacy

- **Tools**
  - <u>Bilateral</u>: MOU, cooperation agreements, twinning agreements
    - Twinning agreements: a commitment to work together in the future (no future end-date terms...but they can be renewed!)
      - You don't really close these twinning agreements, they can just go dormant
    - Cooperation Agreements + Memorandum of Understanding (less strong agreements) $\rightarrow$ it usually goes in order in terms of severity
  - <u>Multilateral</u>: International projects, city networks
    - Time-limited projects are also often linked to external sources of funding
      - Sponsored by institutions by national agencies for development

- Advocacy campaigns: these are things to do with urban affairs, all natural disasters have harshest impact on urban communities
- City branding
  - This could be events like the Olympics marketing stuff related to Paris
- Regional / global events
- Oftentimes, cities can be left out of national government initiatives! (Paris initiatives, they want a say because global climate change affects cities most through heat waves)

#### City Branding

- **City Brands**: Symbolic constructs meant to add meaning or value to cities (I am-sterdam)
  - Example: (I am-sterdam), discontinued because it's too much a city of "individuals"
  - Example: (C-open-hagen), Open city that's progressive
- **City Branding:** The process of managing the brand of a city
  - It's a communication/marketing procedure that wants to highlight a specific side of the city and transform a part of a city!
- **Goals:** 
  - Inspire external and internal audiences
  - Attract investment, talents, and tourism
  - Help export business
- City Brand $\neq$ Logo of the municipality 
  - You cannot copy and paste logos that were successful $\rightarrow$ lots of money spent on really non-impactful work

#### Legal Frameworks

- 2 Legal Frameworks: National and International
  - National: differs from country-to-country
    - These define what cities can do nationally and internationally $\rightarrow$ they might be limited in what they can do
  - International: cities do not have legal personality
    - Cities are seen as subsets of national governments in international law $\rightarrow$ the national government is held responsible for the actions of the city
      - Example: Cities can't help other cities that are not friends for national government (very complex stuff)
      - US and France are not very clear in determining the jurisdiction of cities in terms of international partnership 
- Both legal frameworks are shifting
  - A more "inclusive, multilateralist" – coined by the UN stuff (big challenges should have cities listening and be "given the floor")
- International norms are being introduced into local legal systems

#### Other Terms: Synonyms

- Track 2 Diplomacy (Academia) $\rightarrow$ something in between national and city (also a blanket term)
- Subnational Diplomacy (USA)
- City and State Diplomacy (USA)
- Paradiplomacy (Spanish-speaking countries) $\rightarrow$ pretty similar to track-2 diplomacy (more parallel to it but it's not really "diplomacy", also a blanket term)
- Urban Diplomacy (Germany) $\rightarrow$ this is thematic definition ("urban affairs" are discussed)
- External action of local authorities (French Government)
- European and International Action by Local and Regional Authorities (French Local Authorities)

#### Challenges

- How can we link the local to the international?
- Is it possible to consider cities as coherent entities given their diverse institutional status?
