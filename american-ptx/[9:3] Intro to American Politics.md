## Overview of US Democracy

### Global Political Systems

- **Global Perspective of US Democracy**

  - Parliamentary systems (UK): prime minister is chief executive + head of legislature
  - Presidential systems (US): executive and legislative is separate
  - Semi-presidential systems (Russia): president heads the executive branch (limited powers), prime minister heads legislative branch (more power)

- **Presidential System:** system where the parliament dominates!

  - President is both the head of state and head of government, elected by popular vote
  - Executive and legislative branches are separate; cabinet authority is from the president (separation of power is really important)

  - Branches of government have to negotiate, they compromise for policy
    - Particularly important right now, politics are becoming more polarized
  - Executive branch has to convince and influence the parliamentary actions to develop policy

- **Parliamentary System:** do not stricly separate executive and legislatie

  - Parliament holds significant political control, central to selecting the prime minister
    - Government is accountable to the parliament $\rightarrow$ must have support of the parliament
    - Parliament has a right to a vote of no confidence against the government 
  - Executive has the power (pre-eminence of the executive) once granted by Congress

### US Political System

- **Separation of Powers:** important in a presidential system
  - Rests on the distinction between 3 branches of the state: executive, legislative, judicial
  - Separation is meant to apply "balance" to the relations to three (equal in status) branches $\rightarrow$ balance allow the system to function properly
  - Presidential systems subscribe to this notion in particular
  - Each institution has "<u>checks-and-balances</u>" $\rightarrow$ has tools to control the actions of the others
- **Basic Principles of US Democracy:** "Majority rule with minority rights"
  - <u>Majority rule</u>: wishes of the majority determine what the government does (House of Representatives was elected by the people) $\rightarrow$ large body elected directly by the people
  - Founders feared "tyranny of the majority" $\rightarrow$ protect individual rights against a big, crazy majority in Congress
  - The rights outlined in the "Bill of Rights" are meant to enforce the idea of checks against the tyranny of the majority
- **Separation of Powers V2**: Avoid centralization of big government $\rightarrow$ protect individual liberties
  - Division of executive, legislative, and judicial powers across separate institutions
    - New institutionalism $\rightarrow$ institutions create frames and new ways to look at the world!
  - Power was further divided between two levels: state and federal (federal system)

### Review of US History

- **Principle rooted in History of the US:** Opposition to the British colonial rule (Stamp Act of 1765, Sugar Act of 1764)
  - <u>Tea Act of 1773</u> $\rightarrow$ led to the Declaration of Independence
  - <u>The Boston Tea Party</u> (December 16, 1773) $\rightarrow$ group led by Samuel Adams, threw 342 chests of tea into the harbor
  - <u>The Declaration of Independence</u> (1776) $\rightarrow$ committee consisting of some famous American figures to declare independence from British colonial rule, rejection of centralized government and promotion of individual liberties
- **Declaration of Independence**: philosophically: asserted that government cannot deprive poeple of "unalienable rights" and prioritization of individual liberties
- **The Confederation, First American Government** (1777)
  - November 1777, Continental Congress adopted <u>Articles of Confederation</u> (ratified in 1781, acted until 1788)
    - Goal was to limit the powers of the central government
    - Entire national government consisted of a Congress with very little power (no executive branch)
    - Limited Congressional powers $\rightarrow$ led to a lot of political, civil unrest
- **The New Constitution (Philadelphia Convention)**: 
  - The first constitution was impractical and lacked power to fight internal disorders
  - Created a new government to promote commerce and protect property, led to national judicial supremacy over state courts and a strong presidency
  - Prevents "excessive democracy"
    - Two-chambered (bicameral) legislature
    - Checks and balances among the banches of government
    - Staggered terms in office
    - Indirect election of the president by an electoral college
      - Not the same electoral interest communities, they counter-balance each other!
  - Prevents "abuse of power": incorporation of principles such as the <u>separation of powers</u> and <u>federalism</u> into the Constitution
  - Gain popular support: bill of rights
- **Congress: Stalemate by Design?**
  - <u>Virginia Plan</u> (James Madison): Representation in the national legislature is based on population of each state, proportion of each states' revenue contribution to the national government (biased in favor of large states)
  - <u>The New Jersey Plan</u>: Smaller states want each state to be represented regardless of population
  - <u>Connecticut Compromise</u>: "Great Compromise", strike a good balance between prioritization of states!
    - House of Representatives: Viriginal plan to favor larger states
    - Senate: New Jersey-esque plan to favor the smaller states

### Branches of US Government

- **Congress: The Dominant Institution** 
  - The House was designed to be directly responsible to the people: all members serve 2-year terms
  - Power of the house is checked by the Senate
    - More resistant to electoral and public pressure
    - They serve longer terms here
- **Executive Branch: A Driving Policymaking Force**
  - Designed to overcome the Congressional tendency towards stalemate (it's not ineffective, but it's VERY SLOW)
    - Elected through the electoral college and is independence from the people (electoral) and Congress
  - Foreign Policy Powers: president is granted power to "recognize" other governments, power to negogiate treaties (but this still relies on 2/3 from the Congress)
  - Domestic powers: power to grant reprieves and pardons, oversee executive departments, appoint major departmental personnel, convene Congress in special sessions, veto bills
    - Veto power is very limited (congress can overturn the power
- **The Judiciary:** a check on too much democracy
  - The Supreme Court: supreme judicial authority of the United State
    - Power to resolve any conflicts between federal and state laws $\rightarrow$ determine whether something is exclusive to states or national government
  - Independence: Federal judges are lifetime appointments (completely insulated from political or electoral pressure)
  - Checks and Balances:
    - Judiciary is not free of political consideration: Senate must approve the appointments that are appointed by the president
    - Congress also has the power to change the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 

- **Checks and Balances**
  - Presidential Veto over Congress
  - Congress power of president through control of appointments to high executive posts and to the judiciary
  - Congress has power over the president with money! (Senate to ratify treaties/impeachment)
  - Judiciary has judicial review over the other two branches!
- **Federalism**
  - System of two sovereigns $\rightarrow$ states vs federal government, limit the power of each!
    - Evolution of federalism has involved a loss of state power and increase in federal power
      - The New Deal (Roosevelt) of 1930s: shifted balance of powers and introduced a more formal version of federalism as a response to the Great Depression
