# [9/3] Environmental Federalism

#### Introduction

- Trump is rolling back environmental regulations and recalibrating American federalism
- Withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement for "financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country" and that it did not impose "meaningful obligations on the worlds largest polluters"
- Trump also signaled that he wants to rescind Obama CPP (clean power plan) and other efforts to match Paris $\rightarrow$ efforts also will reignite the coal industry!
- Wants to change power of the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and other federal agencies that had "over-reached" during the Obama Presidency
- Article has a focus on climate change mitigation and water quality protection management 
- The move is important because of environmental federalism that would shift more responsibility to state governments
- Author's take is that reorienting environmental policy through the use of administrative tools rather than legislation is a tenuous strategy for achieving long-term change (Trump may be ineffective in the long-run)

#### Cooperative Federalism

- Scott Pruit (EPA director under Trump) $\rightarrow$ identified "cooperative federalism" along with the “rule of law” and “public participation" as three core policies
  - States should be our nation’s frontline environmental implementers and enforcers

##### Environmental Federalism in Context

- Federalism $\rightarrow$ should states or the federal government take a leading role
- Federal better:
  - "Race to bottom" $\rightarrow$ people will just move to lower cost states and people will keep loosening regulations
  - Spillovers, economices of scale
- States better:
  - One-size-fit-all doesn't work
  - States are more knowledgeable about their individual needs $\rightarrow$ and it could inspire a wave of states improving their stuff
  - Policy experimentation and innovation!
- Democrats favor national control, Republicans favor state
- Structure of this is that EPA sets national standards and authorizes state governments to implement federal programs
  - Clean Air, Clean Water, Safe Drinking Water
  - 96% of these programs have been delegated to the states
- Cooperative federalism is collaborative, and requires high levels of intergovernmental trust
  - Obama shifted authority from states back to federal government
  - Bush had a period of more state-led reforms
  - States can also be different based on the way they view federal programs and things (texas vs California and EPA)

##### Pruitt's Federalism Agenda

- Less federal stuff, he also has a history of being focused on federalism (replaced an environmental governmental office in Oklahoma with federalism task force)

- Sued EPA on behalf of Oklahoma more than 12 times

  - Part of a "strikeforce" to challenge the EPA during Obama

- Sued CPP on the grounds that it was a threat to "reliability and affordability of power"

- Trump's actions

  - EPA, DOI, and other agencies have initiated comprehensive rollback of federal rules and new ones implemented
    - Used the CRA (Congressional Review Act) which allows any regulation by a federal agency to be overturned by a majority vote in both chambers
      - Transparency rule about Exxon and Chevron to disclose taxes and other payments
      - Surface Mining stream protection rule
      - Hunting laws in Alaska
  - Working closer with states

- CRA use $\rightarrow$ might be difficult to repass those laws since the CRA prohibits something like that "substantively similar"

- Pruitt actions

  - Delayed implementation (delaying deadlines for companies and governments to meet federal guidelines)
    - Some of these have been challenged and have run into obstacles in court so the delays have been ineffective.

- More actions: Rescind two other rules

  - CPP (Obama) and Waters of the US rule
  - Promises to also revisit fuel efficiency, coal disposal, and emission rules for other stuff

- Trump has not advocated for any major legislation related to the environment and not signaled for any "to come"

-
