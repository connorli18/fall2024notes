# [9/17] American PTX - Class Notes

#### Legislative Branch

- "The Hill" $\rightarrow$ Capitol Hill (Senate, higher, and House of Representatives)
  - House has 435 members, 100 in Senate
    - 2 years vs 6 year terms
    - 25 minimum age and 30 minimum age
- House of Representatives are in a "permanent state of electoral campaign"
- Senate is more detached from popular pressure
- Veto-player idea: "The more actors participating in the policymaking prcess, the smallest the consensus zone!" $\rightarrow$ Congress is inefficient by design!
  - The Filibuster (Senate Majority Rule) $\rightarrow$ Senate adopted a rule to allow a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster (60% of Senators have to vote to close a bill!)

#### The Veto Player Idea

- Political parties are not unified, they are more like "umbrella organizations" $\rightarrow$ lots of subfactions and caucauses that make it difficult to align with people
  - Filibuster Pivot, Median Voter, Veto Pivot, President! 
  - Legislative & Commitee Procedures

#### How did the ACA Pass?

- Bill Clinton tried to devise a very complex bill that it would control tarriffs of insurance, employer obligation, lots of regulations, etc.
  - It was such a failure that it flipped the House in the next election cycle
- Obama decided to support Healthcare Reform (ObamaCare) $\rightarrow$ Bill Clinton decided to create a task force to write bills and give to Congress, it was hated by Congress!
  - Obama left the writing of bills to Congress!
