# [Session 1] Notes - American Politics

#### Democracy in Persepective

- Parliamentary Systems: prime minister is chief exec and head of legislature
  - UK System
  - Does not explicitly separate executive + legislative
  - Parliament has the most control, government is accountable to parliament $\rightarrow$ right to have a vote of no confidence against government
  - Executive power has autonomy in development of agenda (pre-eminence of exec)
- Presidential Systems: executive + legislative are separate
  - US System
  - President is head of state and head of government, elected by popular vote
  - All branches have to negotiate, exec influences parliament to pass policy (legislative pre-eminence)
- Semi-presidential: president heads executive branch + limited authority, prime minister heads legislative branch
  - Israel, France

#### Separation of Power + US Democracy

- Distinction between basic functions of state - executive, legislative, judicial $\rightarrow$ particularly focused on balance between executive + judicial
  - Divided across institutions
- Presidential systems are most associated with separation of power!
- American Democracy = majority rule with minority rights
  - Majority rule: wishes of the majority determine what the government does (House of Representatives)
    - "Tyranny of majority" $\rightarrow$ want to protect individual rights and liberties (Bill of Rights checks this power)
- Avoid the centralization of government powers $\rightarrow$ fear it might endanger individual liberties
  - Opposition to British colonial rule (anti-tax): Tea Act of 1776, Boston Tea Party, Declaration of Independence 
- Power is further divided into federal + state governments!
- Declaration of Independence
  - Philosophy: "unalienable rights" including "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness"
  - Politically: focused on grievances, goals, and principles that unify the colonists

#### Road to New Constitution

- November 1777: Continental Congress adopted Articles of Confederation (first Constitution) $\rightarrow$ functioned until 1788
  - Goal #1: limit powers of central government (state sovereignty)
  - No president/exec, only Congress with little power (members = messangers from state congress)
  - Congress could declare war, make peace (treaties/alliances), issuing currency, borrowing money, regulating Native American stuff $\rightarrow$ all laws were "enforced" by states
- Second Founding 1787: Philadelphia Convention
  - Problem with first Constitution: lack of power to fight internal disorders, very weak/impractical
  - So, states sent representatives to discuss constitutional revision $\rightarrow$ want to create new gov to promote commerce + protect property
- New Constitution: promote commerce + protect property
  - National control over commerce + finance, national judicial supremacy over state courts, strong president
  - Prevents "execessive democracy":
    - Bicameral (two-chamber) legislature
    - Checks + balances, staggered terms, indirect election
  - Separation of powers + federalism included! 
  - Bill of rights was passed to gain popular support
- Three plans of Congress
  - Virigina Plan (James Madison) - large states: representation in national legislature is based on population of each state/percentage of revenue contribution to national gov
  - New Jersey Plan: Every state should be equal regardless of population
  - Connecticut Compromise (Great Compromise): House is based on population, Senate is where all states get equal representation

#### Congress

- House: designed for "the people", members serve 2 years terms
- Senate: guards against "excessive democracy" $\rightarrow$ appointed by states for longer terms than elected directly
  - Senate is now more resistant to popular pressure, staggered terms in the Senate (1/3 elected every 2 years)

#### Executive Branch

- Designed to overcome stalemate in Congress
- Independent from the people and Congress (election through the electoral college as opposed to direct election)
- Foreign policy powers $\rightarrow$ he can recognize other governments + negotiate treaties
- Domestic powers $\rightarrow$ president can also grant reprieves and pardons, govern executive departments, appoint dept personnel, veto bills (not absolute, 2/3 overrule)!

#### Supreme Court

- Power to resolve any conflicts between federal + state laws
- Federal judges serve lifetime appointments, shielded from political pressure/public pressure
- President appoints judges, Senate approves them $\rightarrow$ Congress can also change jursidiction of federal courts, impeach judges, and change size of Supreme Court

#### Checks and Balances

- President has veto power over Congress
- Congress can control appointmenst of high executive posts + judiciary
- Congress can use power of purse (appropriations) to control executive + Senate has to ratify the treaties that president negotiates
- Supreme court can use judicial review on other two branches

#### US Democratic Principles

- Federalism has evolved to increase federal power
  - Founders limited federal government $\rightarrow$ states had a lot more power
  - Supreme government expanded federal powers, removed interstate barriers to trade, and started national economy
  - New Deal 1930s = government has new federal powers, also during times of crisis (COVID, 9/11, housing crash)
- Liberty: personal freedom + economic freedom (tied to idea of limited government)
  - Part of "life, liberty, pursuit of happiness"
  - Bill of rights delinate 10 personal liberties and rights, and scope of personal liberties has expanded over time (people use courts to challenge their individual freedoms)!
- Equality + Fairness: Equality of opportunity (not of results)...also implies an obligation of the government to the people
  - Political equality: "one person, one vote" even though it used to be worse like white, land-owning males (right to participate in government)
  - Economic equality: economic results are products of individual choices
- Slavery
  - Sourthern + Northern differences: south = planter economy, north = new england merchants
  - 90% of enslaved people were in 5 states and they accounted for 30% of the total population in those states $\rightarrow$ 3/5th compromise (in the new Constitution)
- Voting Restrictions
  - Locke influenced American founders $\rightarrow$ but voting rights are limited to those with property! (economic white elite)
  - Expanded over time (1869) 14th + 15th amendments = slaves can vote, (1965) Voting rights Act, (1920) 19th amendment = women can vote!
- Restrictions on Immigration
  - 1870: up until here, only free whites can be naturalized citizen
  - (14th amendment) people of African descents can now become citizens
  - (1924) Native Americans can be citizen
  - (1940) Asian people can now enter "freely" $\rightarrow$ Chinese exclusion act + WWII
- Rising Inequalities
  - "Guilded Age" $\rightarrow$ late 1800s, a new wealthy elite emerged 
    - 1928, 1/4 of nations wealth belonged to top 1% (10% had 46% wealth)
    - New Deal caused a large middle class to emerge (1% now only owns 9% in the 30s)
    - 2018: top 1% earns 22% of national wealth (10% has 50.5% wealth)
      - Middle income has stagnated but poor $\uparrow$ 1/3 of population
- Unequal political participation (age, racial/ethnicity, family income)
- Barriers to Political Participation
  - Limited political knowledge (American people are dumb) $\rightarrow$ 39% of people can identify all 3 branches
    - Internet + online information:  most people get political info from online but inequalities exist for internet acccess (income, race, education, age)
  - Limited feeling of inclusion: 71% of americans think that elected officials don't care what they think (rose from 1960, 25%)
