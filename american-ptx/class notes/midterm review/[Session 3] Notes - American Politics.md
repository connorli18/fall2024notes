# [Session 3] Notes - American Politics

#### US Congress

- House of Representatives (more in line with political pressure)
  - 435 total members, 2 Year terms, 25 age minimum
  - More rules, more formal, representation by population
  - Special budgetary powers, starts impeachment process
- Senate (more insulated from political pressure)
  - 100 total members, 6 year terms, 30 age minimum
  - Fewer rules, less formal, equal represntation among states
  - Ratifies treaties with governments, approves presidential appointments
- Unicameral (one chamber, more effective, less representative) vs Bicameral (two chamber, less effective, more representative)
- How does a Bill become a law?
  - Introduction
  - Committee Action (hearings/markup)
  - Vote to report bill (writing report)
  - Floor activity (rules committee, debate, votes)
  - Conference (resolve differences if necessary and vote)
  - President - signs or vetoes
  - Law - printed or codified
  - Regulation!
- Idea of "Veto players" $\rightarrow$ More actors participate in policymaking, the smaller the consesus zone is going to be (also if these people are ideologically different, zone is even smaller!)
- Filibuster (Senate Majority Rule) $\rightarrow$ Senate tradition of consensus and unlimited debate
  - 2/3 majority can end a filibuster, called "cloture" (now it is 3/5)
  - Filibuster rule constrains the capacity to vote for reforms $\rightarrow$ when not enough votes, use budgetary bills to win with only simple majority
    - This is also checked by Byrd rule (can't do stuff that's extraneous to budget)
- Factions, Caucus, and Informal Groups (subgroups within political parties, alliances among Congress members, etc.)
- Pivots (Filibuster, Median Voter, Veto Pivot, President)

#### Legislative & Committee Procedures

- Floor rules on House are more formal than Senate
  - House $\rightarrow$ rigid floor debate favors majority, bills referred to a committee by speaker, scheduling controlled by major party
    - Committee action is more important than floor action
  - Senate $\rightarrow$ scheduling agreed to by the majority and minority leaders, majority leader refers committees, floor action = importance of work in committee, filibusters take place

#### Who are Members of Congress?

- Prior Occupation
  - Prior occupations of representatives $\rightarrow$ most are political professionals, then business and banking
  - Prior occupation of senators $\rightarrow$ political professionals are ever more important for this section
- Diversity (racial diversity, still less than US which is ~60%)
  - 23% of Congress identifies as racial minority, more in the House than Senate
  - ~25% of both chambers identify as women
- Professionalization of Members of Congress
  - Average 5 terms, increase in the number of very senior members, and less competitive seats (Congress can be characterized as people spinning out long political careers)
- Member Representational Allowance (MRA) $\rightarrow$ budget between 1.17 - 1.80 million, but budget can vary based on member's priorities
- What motivates a Congressman?
  - (1) Reelection (2) Internal Power (3) Good public policy
- Relection: bias toward implementing policies to benefit target groups instead of universal policy (also helps if they take positions, take credit/blame avoid, and advertise)
- Pork Barrel Politics - "Christmas tree bills" $\rightarrow$ congressional provision that sets aside funds to be spent on projects within a member's district
  - Get legislators to vote for the whole thing because it includes a clause to help that one person's specific things

#### Money and Politics

- Average campaign costs are rising (14 million-ish for Senate, 2.5 million for House)
- Political Action Committee (PAC), leadership PACs can gain clout among their colleagues to donate to them
- Raising money has now become equally as important as the other parts of Congress!

#### The Committee System

- "Committee System" $\rightarrow$ popular from 1947 to 1995, today's system is mostly party leaders, committees were powerful centers of power with their own agendas
  - Lots of standing committees still today!
- Comittee Makeup
  - average 40 legislators in the House and 20 in the Senate on average
  - Divided into thematic subcomitttees (4 and 6)
  - Chaired by a senior member of majority party with ranking member (senior member of minority party on committee), ratio of minority to majority reflects Congressional makeup
- Why committees?
  - (1) Organizational function - facilitate Congress legislative work by splitting into smaller chunks (2) Selection function - select bills that are important (3) Oversight - investigate + conduct hearings on problems for the public
  - Rules: Seniority Rule (only oldest/prestigious people get best positions), Specialization Rule (House has sectorial specialization), Reciprocity rule (Committee's work are not questioned)
- Staffers
  - Personal Staff (administrative assistants, legislative assistants, caseworkers, etc.)
  - Committee staff (draft bills, memos, reports, etc.)
  - Leadership staff (legislative assistants, coordinating staff, floor assistants, legal council)
- Support Agencies: Library of Congress (non-partisan research on specific question), Congressional Budget Office (reviews budgets/tracks spending), GAO accountability office (analyzes how funds are spent), GPO Government printing office 
- Reforms in 20th century were dominated by standing committees (House Ways and Means, Senate Finance) - committee chairs were (Barons)
- Lydon Johnson's Great Society
  - Massive victory of Northern democrats in 1964 - Voting rights Act, Civil Rights Act, Economic Opportunity Act 1964, Creation of Medicare + Medicaid

#### Political Parties in Congress

- Political parties were weak in Congress compared to standing committees (changed in the 1990s)
- Macro-political change (specialized electoral funds, electoral + partisan realignment toward parties, primaries + radicalization of candidates)
- Internal changes (Procedural changes in 1970s, party involvement in bill development, intra-party homogeneity, inter-party conflicts, party involvement in reelection)

- "The Partisan Congress"
  - Party loyalty, more party involvement in campaigning, more involvement in developing bills, defined by party loyalty not seniority rule
  - Fundraising! Fundraising!
- Unorthodox Lawmkaing
  - Consideration of one bill by several committes, bypass of committee examination, making changes during merging of bills, omnibus measures for large-scale reform, increased number of formal + informal summits between executive + legislature, complex + restrictive floor rules
- Why does this change matter?
  - Gridlocks, Legislative process more predictable, less policy stability
