# [Session 6] Notes - American Politics

#### US Political Parties

- Function of political parties

  - Recruitment and selection: Political parties are responsible for recruiting and selecting individuals to run for public office, grooming leaders, and providing candidates for elections.
  - Mediation and representation: Parties serve as a bridge between the public and the government, representing the interests and concerns of their members or supporters in the political arena.
  - Simplifying choice: By grouping policies and ideologies, parties make it easier for voters to make informed decisions during elections, reducing the complexity of choices between numerous candidates.
  - Structuring the political landscape: Political parties provide structure and organization to the political system, often defining the major political divisions within a country (e.g., left vs. right, conservative vs. liberal).
  - Social function (local spoil system): This refers to how parties may provide benefits or patronage (like jobs or resources) to loyal supporters, especially in local politics, fostering a system of loyalty and rewards.

- Basics of US Political Parties

  - Political Organization aimed at winning elections + controlling government (two-party system that's based in "winner take all")

- Party Structures

  - Local party committees + caucuses $\rightarrow$ state committees + conventions $\rightarrow$ National level stuff:
    - DNC, RNC with Congressional committees: NRCC and DCCC
      - DNC/RNC is the national governing body of the party, helps craft platform and strategy
      - NRCC/DCCC helps individuals get elected into the House of Representatives

- American Parties in Comparative Perspective

  - (1885, Woodrow Wilson) Loose association of local elites seeking re-election and influence
  - (1964) Stratarchical model of party organization $\rightarrow$ model of political organization where authority is decentrazlied (not flow-from-top order)
  - Clientelism is a system where political support is exchanged for favors or services, "local spoli system" is how party elites may reward loyal supporters with benefits
  - "Bedfellows coalitions" $\rightarrow$ political coalitions that bring together ideologically diverse groups

- Reponsible Party Government Debate

  - Weakening of parties between 1950s and 1970s

  - Responsible Government Debate: a model where political parties are supposed to play a central role in providing clear policy choices to the electorate, ensuring that elected officials carry out those policies

    - Supporters:

      - It creates more accountability and transparency.

        It ensures clearer governance, making it easier for voters to know what parties stand for.

    - Critics:

      - The U.S. political system, with its checks and balances and federalism, is not designed for strong party discipline, and trying to impose this model would lead to oversimplification and ignore the diversity of interests represented in U.S. politics

- Renewal of Partisanship in 1980s (Rep + Dems are more cohensive + different from one another)

  - White Southerners go from Democrats $\rightarrow$ Republicans
  - $\uparrow$ ideological party activists and the evolution of social and political mobilizations

#### Liberal / Conservative Divide

-  Increased partisan divide since 2016, but it's not ordinary people (they tend to be more moderate)
  - It's political and governmental processes that are becoming polarized, participants are intolerant moralizers, their rhetoric is emotional and excessive
- Tea Party + Remaking of American Conservatism
  - 2008: in opposition to Obama economic policies (revitalization of right-wing activism that is loosely linked with Republican)
  - Conservative media also has a huge role in this development!
  - Tea Party (movement in 2009 supposed to be about fiscal conservatism)
- White Racial Resentment, Rise of Donald Trump
  - Trump won the primaries $\rightarrow$ economic discontent, appeals to white racial fear + resentment
  - Republican party realignment between 1970s and 2000s that transformed the racial, regional, + ideological bases of major parties
- Racial Realignment of American Parties
  - VRA of 1965: share of non-white voters in Souther increased (also nationally!)
  - Non-white share of Democratic voters increased, decrease in percentage of non-white Republican voters!
  - Racial resentment has increased post-Obama
