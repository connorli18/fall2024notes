# [Session 4] Notes - American Politics

#### Political Parties

- Leadership in Congress
  - House
    - Speaker of the House (presiding officer + party leader)
    - Majority + Minority Floor Leader
    - Majority Whip + Minority Whip
  - Senate
    - President of Senate, President Pro Tempore (Presiding Officers)
    - Majority + Minority Floor Leader
    - Majority Whip + Minority Whip
- Republican Revolution of 1994 - Newt Gingrich took advantage of committee inexperience and popularity to empower partisanship
  - "Whips" - people responsible for counting and securing votes!
- "Unorthodox Lawmaking" - extent of change (set of procedures/practices that are new/used more often now!)
- Filibusters have increased as a result of party polarization, so reform has taken a budgetary process to break filibuster!
- Increased use of "bypassing committees" $\rightarrow$ first started as task forces (use of floor control tools, direct negotiations with WH, stakeholders, party Leaders, other party excluded from legislative process)

#### Presidential Powers

- Presidents influence policy by (1) choosing people who are sympathetic with their agenda, using regulatory review + XOs to make policy, setting Congress agenda
- US president is weak in comparison to other countries (we are 1 / 8)
- 4 types of institutional powers: expressed powers, implied powers, delegated powers, inherent powers of the office (informal)

- Expressed Powers (Art. 2 Section 2-3)
  - Military: Commander in Chief of all the branches of the military
  - Judicial: grants reprieves and pardons for offences against US
  - Diplomatic: can make treaties
  - Executive: monitors that the laws are "faithfully executed", power to appoint judges/executive officers
  - Legislative: Article I, Sec 7 and Article 2 Sec 3, agenda setting and veto power!
- Implied Powers: anything inferred that is necessary to carry out the presidency that isn't explicitly listed in Constitution
  - "Theory of unitary executive" $\rightarrow$ all executive power belongs to president except limited by Constitution
  - President controls all policymaking in the executive branch, but critics say that Congressional oversight is stronger than unitary theory
- Delegated powers
  - Congress has delegated a great deal of its legislative authority to the execution branch
  - Regulatory powers: implementation laws by developing regulations to affect American businesses + citizen
- Inherent Powers
  - Set of powers that stem from the rights, duties, and obligations of presidency (not specified in the Constitution)
  - War/National emergency - inherent powers to defend nation!
- President + Congress
  - Separation of power and the need for inter-institutional coalitions $\rightarrow$ they need to legislate together or nothing will happen!
  - President is the "cheerleader in chief" $\rightarrow$ distinction between power and influence, no direct power over the branch
  - They have "influence" over Congress - persuasian (resources, personal,  transactional, symbolic, etc.)
    - Legislative impulse (agenda-setting power), speeches on state of the Union
    - Providing expertise on a certain topic
    - Presidential veto!
- White House can also lobby Congress! $\rightarrow$ offices of legislative affairs (controversial bills and presidential direct intervention)
  - Example: Obama can lobby for change, Congress pushes him to make declarative statements about change
- Congress can also stall voting on presidnetial budget, that's how they can also exert influence!

#### Structural Features of Presidential

- Political types vs. Personality types $\rightarrow$ stability in structure of leadership in 19th and 20th century
- Political time is cyclical - "regimes" that have a certain set of commitments
- Read skowroneck!

#### White House

- Staff: 2000 men and women, give the president capacity for action
  - Cabinet (15 major heads of government departments) $\rightarrow$ secretary, deputy secretary, undersecretaries, assistant secretaries
  - Analysts, advisers, etc.
  - Executive office of president: EOP agencies like Office of Management Budget (OMB) or National Security Council
- Other White House functions
  - First lady, VP :) 

#### Presidential Powers

- Expansion of Presidential powers, reduce their dependence on Congress 
  - Going public: he can pressure the American people to put pressure on Congress
  - OMB, increasing presense of this office can do budgetary things now!
  - Regulatory review can do without congress too!
- Governing by Decrees (unilateral without Congress)
  - Executive orders: beauracracy should do something
  - Administrative orders: national security findings/directives, presidential proclamations, memorianda
  - Signing statements: taking a position on a bill
  - Non enforcement of laws!
