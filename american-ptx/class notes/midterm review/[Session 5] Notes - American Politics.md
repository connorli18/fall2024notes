# [Session 5] Notes - American Politics

#### White House Review

- Johnson deserves credit $\rightarrow$ he had the greatest ability of any president to get things done
  - Style of President + personal influence, informal mechanisms like personal skills, informal knowledge, loyalty relationships, etc. are useful persuasion tools
- Joe Biden!
  - Senator (1873-2009)
  - VP (2009-2017)

#### Judicial Power + Supreme Court

- Rosenberg + Hollow Hope (constrained court view, dynamic court view, hollow hope)
- The Legal System (Common Law System)
  - Based on law + precedents, criminal law, civil law (contracts + torts)
- Architecture of federal Judicial System
  - 94 judicial districts
  - 11 regional circuits + DC circuit (appellate jurisdiction)
  - Supreme Court (6500+ cases filed with Supreme Court, <100 get review!)
- Supreme Court (Art 3 of Constitution)
  - Embodies judicial power of US, the only federal Court established by the Constitution
  - "Least dangerous branch" $\rightarrow$ designed to protect individual liberties + freedom against threat of tyranny of majority 
  - Current Supreme Court
    - Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Niel Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson
    - 6/9 Justices were Republican appointees (conservative majority, John Roberts, Samuel Alto, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh Amy Coney Barrett) $\rightarrow$ more conservative rulings
  - Appointment Process
    - Nomination by President, Confirmation by Senate Judiciary Committee (no formal qualifications required, and increased partisanship among parties)
- Powers of Supreme Court
  - Article 3 gives Supreme Court jurisdiction on 
    - (1) cases between US vs. states
    - (2) cases between states
    - (3) cases involving foreign people
    - (4) cases of state vs another state citizen or foreign country!
  - Cases/controversy, standing, mootness - are most commonly reviewed by the Supreme Court, conflicting decision by federal courts/appeals to federal government (preferences + priorities of justices)
- Case Review Process
  - Cases on the docket: The Supreme Court reviews petitions for cases. A minimum of four justices must agree to hear the case, known as the "Rule of Four."
  - Briefs submitted by both sides; amicus curiae briefs filed: Both parties submit written briefs outlining their arguments. Outside parties (amicus curiae) may also submit briefs to provide additional perspectives.
  - Oral argument: Attorneys from both sides present their arguments in front of the justices, who ask questions to clarify points of law or fact.
  - Conference; cases discussed; votes taken; opinion writing assigned: After oral arguments, the justices meet privately to discuss the case and vote. If a majority (at least five justices) agree, one justice is assigned to write the opinion.
  - Opinions drafted; circulated for comment: The assigned justice drafts the majority opinion, which is circulated among the justices. Dissenting and concurring opinions may also be drafted.
  - Decision announced: The final decision is announced to the public, establishing precedent that lower courts must follow
- Lobbying the Court: Presidential influence + Interest groups, NGOs, lobbies, etc. (they often back one side of the case too)
- Judicial Philosophies: Originalism or Activism?
  - Originalism: Courts should interpret the Constitution according to the stated intentions of its framers and defer to the views of Congress when interpreting federal statute
  - Judicial activism: The Court should go beyond the words of the Constitution or a statute to consider the broader societal implications of its decisions
