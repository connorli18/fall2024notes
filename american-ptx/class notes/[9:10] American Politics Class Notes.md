# [9/10] American Politics Class Notes

### Principles at the Core of US Democracy

- Liberty: one of the most important principles of US Democracy
  - Individualistic culture, personal freedom, economic freedom!
  - Bill of rights and the courts have an important role in expanding these liberties of the people
- Equality: obligation of the government to the people (not the equality of results, but it's the equality of opportunity!)
  - Political equality: same opportunity to succeed (for marginalized communities)
  - Equal right to participate! (government should enforce equality in that sense)
  - A big question is about reparations? How do we address inequalities in the past that may be affecting our currently "equality"?
    - There is a trend of improving equality $\rightarrow$ although it's probably not there yet!
  - Tend to be more skeptical against government action against inequality
  - Economic equality is a different perspective $\rightarrow$ linked in religion/personal success!
