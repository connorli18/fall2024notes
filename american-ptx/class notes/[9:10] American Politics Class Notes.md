# [9/10] American Politics Class Notes

### Review of American Democracy

#### Principles at the Core of US Democracy

- Liberty: one of the most important principles of US Democracy
  - Individualistic culture, personal freedom, economic freedom!
  - Bill of rights and the courts have an important role in expanding these liberties of the people
- Equality: obligation of the government to the people (not the equality of results, but it's the equality of opportunity!)
  - Political equality: same opportunity to succeed (for marginalized communities)
  - Equal right to participate! (government should enforce equality in that sense)
  - A big question is about reparations? How do we address inequalities in the past that may be affecting our currently "equality"?
    - There is a trend of improving equality $\rightarrow$ although it's probably not there yet!
  - Tend to be more skeptical against government action against inequality
  - Economic equality is a different perspective $\rightarrow$ linked in religion/personal success!

#### Question of Slavery

- Fundamental difference between Southern and Northern states related to stlavery and racial segegration
  - Different economies (agricultural vs industrial) $\rightarrow$ the Southern states were considered "small states", which affected a lot of political development
  - Slaves were not considered citizens at first (3/5), but they made up 30% of the population in the Southern states

#### Voting Restrictions

- Began as a "limited democracy" $\rightarrow$ political participation was limited to White middle and upper class 
  - 14th amendment: provided former slaves with voting rights
  - Voting Rights Acts (1960)
  - 1920 (19th amendment): women get the right to vote

- 80% of the American population was excluded from the voting population at it's inception $\rightarrow$ those numbers are better today but still not 100%

#### Restrictions on Immigration

- Efforts to Limit the Non-White population: 1790 (free whites can only be naturalized citizens)
  - African-descent citizens could not be recognized utnil 1868
  - Native Americans (1924) until they could be citizens
  - Asian people were restricted until 1940s $\rightarrow$ law was ended during WWII when we became allies with China
- Power of the majority: this is why the white people want to control the citizenship process

#### Rising Inequalities

- 1928: 25% of national wealth belonged to the top 1% (10% took home 46%) 
- New Deal $\rightarrow$ 1% now owns 9% of the nation's wealth!
- Response from Reagan $\rightarrow$ deregulation and destruction of many social legislations that led to a "new guilded age"
- 2018: 1% earns 22% of national wealth, 10% takes 50.5%
  - Middle class income stagnated and amount of poor $\uparrow$ 33%

#### Political Participation

- Political Participation has never been great, a lot of people abstain especially when there are no presidential elections at stake!
  - Across racial groups, we have ranking (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian) $\rightarrow$ sitting around 40-55% of political participation of minorities
  - Young kids also do not tend to vote!
  - Voter turnout is positively correlated with family income! (income can be a barrier to political participation)
- Barriers to Political Participation
  - Limited Political Knowledge: Biased/no political information is known, they may not even know the basics of how the government works
  - Internet and Online Info: Get political information online, but there are barriers to access based on income, race, etc.
  - Feeling of inclusion: A lot of people think that "elected officials don't care about them"

### Politics of Federalism

#### Basic Concepts

- Separation of powers, avoid centralization of governmental powers (might endanger individual liberties)
- Declaration of Independence (1776) $\rightarrow$ Federal system including 13 states, now there are 50 states!
  - Delegates elected/nominated on behalf of territories don't get any say in Congress (they're just delegates)
- History of States/Federal
  - States originally had most of the rights - militia, education, taxation, etc.

#### Dynamics of Federalism

- System of two sovereigns, the state and the nation, and the principle of competition is the limit the power of each
- Strong states at the start but the gradual growth of the federal level in the 19th Century: the Supreme Court was really important for expanding federal power (removed interstate barriers to trade and laid groundwork for national economy)
- The New Deal of the 1930s $\rightarrow$ shifted power of the national government

#### US Federalism in Perspective

- United States was the first nation to adopt federalism as its governing framework $\rightarrow$ strongly influenced other federal systems 
  - Argentina, Australia, Belgium, etc.

- Specifics of US Federalism
  - States and local governments have more power than in other federal countries!
    - Other federalism is to bring ethnic and cultural divisions together in different geographical areas, but the US is to bring smaller units of government together
  - The US does not equalize regional resources by redistributing resources to the poorest regions $\rightarrow$ federalism is very elastic and can adjust to geographic, cultural, ethnic changes
- Promises of Federalism
  - Protects freedoms and rights, guarantees democracy, promotes government efficiency, allows policy innovation (states are the "sites of policy innovation"), fosters prosperity
  - States have an innovative role that is important in US federalism! (supposed to be good for commerce too)
- Limits in Practice
  - States are not great for protecting individual rights (segregation in 1960s in the Southern states)
  - States will often just preserve economic interests + political agendas, state governments are not always super efficient
  - Decentralised policy can result in higher transaction costs, powerful minorities can make decisions in policy-making without majority support (political elites and economic elites are influential together)

#### Federal Politics is Politics!

- Political battlefield for all important American conflicts (instrumentalization for broader political priorities) $\rightarrow$ labour, environment, education, gay rights, abortion
- Republicans (support states), Democrats (support federal government)

#### Distribution of Power

- Constitution grants federal level only those specifically expressed in its text
- Elastic clause (US Constitution art. 1 section 8): Congress can write laws needed to carry out its expressed powers $\rightarrow$ source of strenght to national government
- 10th Amendment: powers not granted by Constitution to the federal government are reserved to the states or to the people!
  - Struggles between federal + state = constitutional struggles

#### Federalism and Development of the USA

- Growth of federal level overtime
- Adaptation to a constrained environment: federal grant in aid to states to motivate each state to comply with national policy priorities (power of the purse)
  - Over 500 billion annually on grants-in-aid
  - 3rd largest item in the budget after Social Security + National Defense
  - "Extend its influence into states and local affairs"
- Supreme court allows more federal regulation of the domestic ecnonomy (state grants became a part of the federal government)
- 3 Types of Grants (how the federal government is able to drive state policies):
  - Categorical Grants: only used for very specific programs and are accompanied with very strict conditions on how the states should spend this money (very well-defined) 
  - Block Grants: Federal money that broadly aims to solve policy issues, not specified on how states should exactly spend this money! â€“ much less restrictive
  - General Revenue Sharing: This could be used for any purpose that is not explicitly prohibited

- Grants have been expanded over time and many other federal programs have been added
  - Health, income security, education, transportation, community and regional development, natural resources and environment, energy, other!
  - Medicaid has improved a lot (as a share of federal grants) $\rightarrow$ 

#### Big Picture Evolution

- Progressive era reformers (increased engagement and professionalization of governemnt at all levels)
- New Deal increased federal government
- Post WWII liberals also wanted to equality opportunities and reduce risk nationally
- Conversatives in the 1980s inherited a very active federal government $\rightarrow$ tried to then reduce power of the federal government
