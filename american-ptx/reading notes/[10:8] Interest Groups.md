# [10/8] Interest Groups

### Overview

#### Top Level

- National organizations representing marginalized groups are less active in advocating for intersectionally disadvantaged subgroups compared to more advantaged subgroups
- Issues affecting disadvantaged subgroups are downplayed and framed as narrow and particularistic, while those affecting advantaged subgroups are framed as broadly impactful
- Despite genuine intentions to represent disadvantaged members, organizations focus more attention on issues affecting advantaged subgroups, even when the impact is limited
- This leads to a disparity in advocacy, with more attention given to issues affecting advantaged subgroups regardless of their overall importance

#### Introduction

- Interest groups have historically represented corporate and professional interests, but since the 1960s, organizations like the NAACP, NOW, and CLASP have also represented marginalized groups (e.g., women, racial minorities, low-income people)
- These organizations provide a crucial voice for groups that lack formal political representation and are often underserved by the two major political parties
- Despite their growth and visibility in Washington politics, questions remain about how effectively these organizations represent their members, particularly disadvantaged subgroups within marginalized communities
- A study using data from 286 national advocacy organizations and interviews with 40 organization officers found that while some representation exists for disadvantaged members, organizations are significantly less active on issues affecting disadvantaged subgroups

### The New Mobilization of Bias

- Many of these advocate groups emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, promising to advance social justice and equality for those underserved by the political system.
- Despite their growth, these organizations remain less powerful than trade, business, and professional groups.
- There is a middle-class bias, with organizations often prioritizing issues like environmentalism over economic justice for low-income or working-class members.
- Organizations focused on economic justice tend to downplay issues related to race, gender, and sexuality
  - Strategically, groups focus on broad issues that appeal to their "median member," neglecting smaller, more controversial issues that affect disadvantaged subgroups.
  - They tend to prioritize politically popular or winnable issues to maintain member support and avoid alienating allies
- Due to socioeconomic bias and low membership from disadvantaged groups, these subgroups receive less attention.
- Niche theory suggests organizations focus on specific policy areas where they have expertise, avoiding new or less familiar issues that impact disadvantaged subgroups

### Intersectional Marginalization

- Intersectional approaches argue that organizations fail to address issues affecting subgroups whose marginalization stems from multiple, overlapping disadvantages (e.g., African-American gay men facing both racial and sexual discrimination).
- These disadvantages are not additive but dynamic, creating unique and compounded inequalities that intersect in complex ways (Crenshaw 1989).
- Traditional advocacy groups in the U.S. typically focus on single axes of oppression (e.g., gender, race, poverty), failing to capture the complexities of intersectional marginalization.
- Single-axis organizations often represent the interests of more privileged members of a group, leaving the issues of intersectionally disadvantaged subgroups unaddressed and causing their needs to "fall through the cracks."
- Gains from advocacy efforts tend to benefit members privileged in all but one form of disadvantage, resulting in uneven progress across the group.

### Policy Topology

- Intersectionality is difficult to measure systematically, and existing frameworks often oversimplify by distinguishing only between single-axis and intersectional issues.
- Traditional frameworks fail to differentiate between majority issues and advantaged-subgroup issues within marginalized groups.
- Strategic theories (e.g., Downsian) suggest that organizations focus on issues based on their breadth of impact, but this ignores the power dynamics emphasized by intersectional approaches.
- The author introduces a four-part typology to classify policy issues:
  1. Universal issues (affect everyone, e.g., Social Security).
  2. Majority issues (affect all members of an organization, e.g., violence against women).
  3. Disadvantaged-subgroup issues (affect marginalized subgroups, e.g., welfare reform for low-income women).
  4. Advantaged-subgroup issues (benefit privileged subgroups, e.g., affirmative action for middle-class women).
- Most organizations claim to represent broad constituencies, stating that they address the concerns of multiple marginalized groups.
- Organizations report broad interest across various policy areas (e.g., civil rights, health, labor).
- Advocacy for disadvantaged subgroups should not be framed as altruism; these members are part of the constituency, and advocating for them is a responsibility, not charity.

### Data

- While organizations claim broad constituencies and policy mandates, existing theories suggest low activity on issues affecting intersectionally disadvantaged subgroups.
- There has been no quantitative, comparative study examining advocacy for marginalized subgroups across groups and issues, making it difficult to assess the problem or explanations for it.
- To address this, the author conducted the **Survey of National Economic and Social Justice Organizations (SNESJO)** in 2000, surveying 286 national advocacy organizations (40% response rate).
- The survey included organizations representing women, racial minorities, and low-income groups, with 62% being membership organizations.
- The data set contains 712 records (four policy issues per organization), allowing for a systematic analysis of representation for disadvantaged subgroups.

### Survey Measures of Policy Activity

- The study measures interest group advocacy activity on four policy issues, with respondents rating their organization's activity on a 1-5 scale (1 = not active, 5 = very active).

- Policy issues were chosen based on their presence on the federal policy agenda (1990-2000) and categorized into majority, advantaged-subgroup, disadvantaged-subgroup, and universal issues.

- Example: Asian-American organizations were asked about hate crimes (majority issue), affirmative action in government contracting (advantaged-subgroup issue), violence against women (disadvantaged-subgroup issue), and Social Security (universal issue).

- These categories are somewhat subjective, as concepts like race, gender, and policy impact are malleable, but responses support the classification of issues.

- Approximately 40% of respondents said majority and universal issues affect “almost all” of their members, while advantaged-subgroup and disadvantaged-subgroup issues affected fewer members (26.2% and 17.5%, respectively).

### Hypothesis + Model

- The hypothesis tested is that organizations are less active on issues affecting disadvantaged subgroups compared to majority or advantaged-subgroup issues.
- The level of advocacy activity for each of the four policy issues (minus the organization’s average activity on the other three issues) was analyzed through ordered logit regression, incorporating various independent and control variables.
  - Four dummy variables were created to represent each policy type (Universal, Majority, Advantaged subgroup, Disadvantaged subgroup), with Universal issues as the control group.
  - Additional variables included the proportion of members affected by the issue, organizational maintenance concerns (e.g., members agreeing with or concerned about the issue), and external factors like political opportunities, threats, and issue salience.
- The analysis controlled for political conditions and public opinion, using measures such as agenda salience and public agreement/controversy on the issue.
- Niche theories were tested by analyzing the number of organizations in an issue's primary and secondary niche sectors and how these influenced advocacy decisions.
  - The model controlled for institutional capacity using factors like budget allocation, number of members, and paid staff. 
  - Robust standard errors were used to account for clustering, and ordered logit regression was applied due to the bounded nature of the dependent variable (1-5 scale).

### Findings

- Table 2b shows that organizations are most active on majority issues (83%), followed by advantaged-subgroup issues (81%), disadvantaged-subgroup issues (60%), and universal issues (43%).

- The regression model (Table 3) confirms that organizations are less active on issues affecting disadvantaged subgroups, revealing that the low activity levels cannot simply be explained by the issues only affecting a subgroup of members.

- An intersectional approach, considering group size, advantage, and status, better explains the variation in advocacy levels across different issues.

- Other factors in the model further contribute to the biases against disadvantaged-subgroup issues, intensifying the lack of attention given to these issues.

### Policy Type + Proportion of Members Affected

- Organizations allocate less advocacy to issues with broader member impact; broader issues get less attention.
  - Advantaged-subgroup issues receive the most attention, even with fewer members affected.
- Intersectional effect: Majority and disadvantaged-subgroup issues get more advocacy as member impact increases, but this does not apply to advantaged-subgroup issues.
- Double standard: Advantaged-subgroup issues always receive high advocacy, while majority and disadvantaged-subgroup issues depend on the number of members affected.
- Framing differences: Advantaged-subgroup issues are framed broadly (affecting many), while disadvantaged-subgroup issues are framed narrowly, justifying less attention.
  - Example: Women’s organizations are more active on violence against women and affirmative action (both framed broadly), but less on welfare reform (framed narrowly).
- Organizations strategically conflate status and impact, boosting advantaged-subgroup issues and downplaying disadvantaged-subgroup issues as particularistic.
  - Organizations echo dominant political framing, but also attempt to reframe some issues (e.g., abortion as choice). Welfare reform, however, remains narrowly framed in line with dominant narratives.

### Exacerbating the Bias: Member Concern and Support

- Low advocacy on disadvantaged-subgroup issues is partly due to organizations downplaying the impact these issues have on affected members.
  - Member concern is a key factor influencing advocacy; organizations are more active on issues with higher member concern (e.g., when they receive “lots of phone calls”).
  - Agreement with an organization's position also drives activity—organizations avoid taking action on issues unless they believe most members agree with their stance.
    - Example: An Asian-American organization avoids addressing violence against women due to it being a taboo subject within the community.
  - Focusing on member interest makes sense, but this practice reduces advocacy on disadvantaged-subgroup issues, which tend to generate less concern and agreement.
- Disadvantaged-subgroup issues typically receive less member concern (only 30%) compared to majority (58%) and advantaged-subgroup issues (45%).
  - Advantaged subgroups are more likely to have resources to express their concerns, leading to disproportionate attention to their issues.
  - Member dissent can prevent advocacy, as seen with violence against women in Asian-American organizations, where dissent prevents action on women’s issues.
  - Responding to objections by avoiding disadvantaged-subgroup issues further marginalizes these groups, validating the notion that their concerns are less important.

### Political Environment: Public Agreement, Controversy, Agenda

- Public opinion and controversy do not significantly affect organizational advocacy levels, but political agenda salience (attention from policymakers) has a positive, significant impact.
  - Niche theory suggests organizations focus on issues where they see opportunities and avoid areas they think belong to other groups, especially for disadvantaged-subgroup issues.
    - Example: Women's organizations avoid welfare reform, seeing it as an economic justice issue, while economic justice groups avoid reproductive health services due to other capable organizations covering that space.
- The analysis confirms niche-based decisions: Organizations refrain from disadvantaged-subgroup and majority issues when they believe another group "owns" the issue.
  - Advantaged-subgroup issues are exempt from niche considerations, with organizations often increasing their activity in sectors where more groups are involved ("the more the merrier" effect).
  - Strategic considerations like niche allocation apply only to majority and disadvantaged-subgroup issues, not advantaged-subgroup issues, showing a double standard.

### Economic vs Social Issues

- The findings align with Berry's and Skocpol's arguments that identity-based organizations neglect economic justice issues, like women's organizations' low activity on welfare reform.
  - However, the problem is broader: intersectional marginalization affects not only economic issues but also social and identity-based issues across various organization types.
- Economic justice organizations neglect intersectionally disadvantaged subgroups (e.g., labor organizations have low activity on job discrimination for women and minorities).
- Identity-based groups do the same; for instance, Asian-American organizations have low activity on violence against women, and civil rights groups are less active on LGBT discrimination.
  - The data show the issue is a general problem driven by power and advantage, with advocacy focused more on middle-class concerns over low-income or intersectionally disadvantaged groups.
  - Consistent patterns across organization types suggest that the findings are robust, and using different policy issues would likely produce similar results.

### Conclusion & Discussion

- Advocacy organizations play a crucial role in representing marginalized groups (women, racial minorities, low-income people) and supplement their political voice.
  - However, there are persistent barriers to representing disadvantaged subgroups within these marginalized groups.
- Intersectional analysis shows that advocacy is influenced by the relative status of the subgroup, with advantaged-subgroup issues framed as having broader impact, receiving more attention, while disadvantaged-subgroup issues are underrepresented.
  - Organizations apply a double standard: advantaged-subgroup issues get attention regardless of scope, while disadvantaged-subgroup issues are mostly neglected.
  - Strategic influences like political opportunities, member concerns, and niche carving further reinforce biases against disadvantaged subgroups.
- Small representation: Of nearly 12,000 organizations in Washington Representatives (2001), only a tiny fraction represent marginalized groups—less than 5% are public interest groups, less than 4% are identity-based groups, and less than 1% represent poor or low-income people.
  - These figures demonstrate the significant challenges marginalized groups face in gaining representation in national politics.
