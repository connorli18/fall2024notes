# [9/17] American PTX - Reading 4

#### Overview (Clinton)

- Clinton was a "survivor" $\rightarrow$ they tried to oust him out of office, and they were not successful (his presidency was also not that great!)
  - The first "postmodern" president
  - Clinton wars were about control of the national political agenda; less about Clinton than the political project he gave to the nation!

#### Recurrent Structures of Political Authority

- American system has made sweeping political system rare, but some insurgencies have succeeded
  - Jeffersonian democracy (1800-1828), New Deal (1932-1980)
- Presidents strive to legitimize their authority by reconciling the disruptive effects of their actions with the constitutional purpose of their office
- Both successes and failures alter the political landscape, redistributing advantages across the system
  - Presidential authority is shaped by constraints, and some strategies prove more successful than others
- The article outlines a framework for understanding presidential authority, based on two factors:
  1. Whether the president is affiliated with or opposed to the dominant ideological commitments of the time
  2. Whether those commitments are resilient or vulnerable<img src="/Users/connorli/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screenshot 2024-09-17 at 3.28.13 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-17 at 3.28.13 PM" style="zoom:33%;" />

- Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton each represented different combinations of these leadership types. Their leadership styles and claims to authority were influenced by their relationship to the dominant political commitments of their era.

#### Jimmy Carter: Politics of Disjunction

- 1976 Presidential Context:
  - A Democratic victory was seen as a potential restoration of the New Deal liberal regime. However, confidence in liberal solutions was waning due to internal turmoil, economic challenges, and radical conservatism's resurgence

- Jimmy Carter's Approach:

  - Carter focused on reforming the inefficiencies in government rather than altering liberal commitments, positioning himself as a technocratic leader capable of repairing the system

  - His promise of reform while maintaining continuity of liberal commitments was a difficult balancing act, leading to criticism of his leadership as overly technical and lacking political savvy

- Historical Pattern of Late-Regime Affiliates:

  - Carter’s struggle resembled that of previous late-regime affiliates (e.g., John Quincy Adams, Herbert Hoover) who promised to repair old political regimes but failed due to systemic issues

  - Such presidents are often seen as politically incompetent because they cannot reconcile regime maintenance with changing political circumstances

- Carter's Independence and Limits:

  - Carter demonstrated more political independence than previous late-regime affiliates, distancing himself from liberal orthodoxy through fiscal austerity and defense buildup

  - Despite his efforts, his leadership remained constrained by his party's liberal legacy, culminating in his defeat by the Republican insurgency in 1980

#### Ronald Reagan: Politics of Reconstruction

- Late-Regime Affiliates' Impact:
  - Presidents like Jimmy Carter, who lead at the end of political regimes, often fail to restore credibility and instead highlight systemic political failure, paving the way for insurgents like Ronald Reagan to propose new governing solutions

- Reagan's Leadership:
  - Reagan capitalized on Carter's vulnerabilities, framing liberal government as the source of national problems and proposing a fresh start, aligning himself with transformative presidents like Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR

- Reconstructive Leadership:
  - Successful reconstructive presidents rise in times of perceived political collapse, using repudiative leadership to discredit the old regime and establish new ideological and programmatic commitments. They are typically great communicators and resolute ideologues, who promise to restore American values and dismantle entrenched elites and institutions

- Reagan's Reconstruction:

  - Reagan's presidency was marked by a rhetorical revolution rather than deep institutional change. His initial tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks were followed by a stalemate with Congress, preventing a more aggressive dismantling of liberal government

  - Reagan’s major tool was the budget deficit, which constrained future federal initiatives and allowed liberal programs to atrophy over time without direct dismantling

- Postmodern Constraints:
  - Reagan’s reconstruction was limited by contemporary features of American government, such as increased political autonomy and administrative integration with interest groups, making it harder for a reconstructive leader to mobilize widespread systemic transformation

#### George H.W. Bush: Politics of Articulation

- Leadership Challenges of Orthodox Innovators:

  - Presidents like George H.W. Bush, who follow a reconstructive leader (e.g., Reagan), struggle with being compared to their transformative predecessors and with turning their legacy into a workable system of government

  - Orthodox innovators pledge to uphold and build on existing regime commitments but often face internal dissent over how to adapt these commitments to new challenges, leading to factional disputes

- Difficulties of Orthodox Innovation:

  - These presidents experience high expectations but struggle to sustain leadership authority, as their actions often provoke internal conflicts over the true interpretation of the regime’s commitments

  - Orthodox innovators face political isolation, as their attempts to affirm established ideals create divisions among their own supporters

- George H.W. Bush's Presidency:

  - Bush exemplified the challenges of orthodox innovators. Despite initial popularity after the Gulf War, he was politically weakened by breaking his "no new taxes" pledge, which alienated conservative Republicans and led to internal party conflict

  - Like other orthodox innovators, Bush became increasingly isolated and ultimately discredited by his own party for compromising on core issues

- Historical Pattern:
  - Throughout American history, orthodox innovators have rarely been reelected, and their leadership often leads to factional splintering within their regimes. Even the most successful innovators, like Monroe, Polk, and Theodore Roosevelt, ended their terms with fractured political bases

- Postmodern Presidency:
  - In the contemporary political climate, the challenges of orthodox innovation are exacerbated by the personal nature of modern politics, where presidents are expected to have distinct visions. This contrasts with their role as stewards of an established orthodoxy, making it harder to sustain a collective political identity while exercising personal leadership

#### Bill Clinton: Politics of Pre-emption

- Bill Clinton's Third-Way Leadership:
  - Clinton sought to carve out a "third way" between liberalism and conservatism in the post-Reagan era, recognizing the discredited state of liberalism while opposing orthodox conservatism
  - His strategy aimed to redefine Democratic politics, distancing from the past and finding a middle ground. Clinton was more focused on economic management, critiquing Republican policies while acknowledging that "big government" was no longer viable
- Preemptive Leadership Style:
  - Clinton's leadership, like that of other preemptive leaders (e.g., Woodrow Wilson, Richard Nixon), was characterized by a lack of clear ideological alignment, allowing for flexibility but often leading to accusations of manipulation and lack of principles
  - Preemptive leaders exploit divisions within the dominant political coalition and present hybrid agendas, but their leadership tends to be highly personalized, unstable, and temporary
- Historical Pattern of Preemptive Leaders:
  - Preemptive presidents like Wilson, Nixon, and Clinton often rise to power during times of schism within the dominant political coalition and win elections with a minority of the popular vote
  - These leaders, though successful at the polls, struggle with authenticity and face personal attacks that challenge their character and legitimacy
  - Many preemptive leaders, including Clinton, faced impeachment or severe political challenges, reflecting their disruption of established political norms
- Clinton's Resilience:
  - Unlike other preemptive leaders, Clinton weathered numerous political crises, including the health care reform failure, the 1994 midterm losses, and the impeachment crisis of 1998. His survival in these crises is attributed to both a strong national economy and his ability to navigate the atomized, entrepreneurial political environment of modern governance
- Contemporary Relevance:
  - Clinton’s leadership style fits well with modern politics, where personal political networks and flexible agendas are more prevalent. In contrast, orthodox innovators (like George H.W. Bush) struggle in this environment, making preemptive leadership increasingly relevant in today’s political landscape

#### Continuity & Change in Politics of Leadership

- Late 20th Century Presidential Leadership:
  - The last four presidents of the 20th century—Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton—each adopted distinct leadership strategies, responding to the political conditions left by their predecessors. Despite their differences, their approaches followed recurring patterns in American presidential history

- Recurrent Structures of Presidential Authority:
  - Presidential leadership often involves reconciling the disruptive effects of power with an order-affirming purpose. The cyclical patterns of reconstructive leadership, preemptive leadership, and orthodox innovation continued through the century, though modern conditions modified the effectiveness of these styles

- Impact of Postmodern Conditions:
  - Institutional security and expanding resources for presidential action have made reconstructive leadership more challenging and rendered orthodox innovation somewhat anachronistic. Preemptive leaders, like Clinton, have benefited from these conditions, allowing them to maintain control in volatile political environments

- Clinton’s Legacy and the 2000 Election:
  - Clinton’s preemptive leadership ultimately gave way to a Republican “restoration” symbolized by George W. Bush, although Clinton’s successor, Al Gore, won the popular vote. Gore’s campaign sought to distance itself from Clinton while also benefiting from Clinton's legacy, nearly achieving a historic victory
