# [9/30] American Politics Reading

# The Dynamic and Constrained Court

## Chapter 1

### Overview

- Courts are slow at producing significant social reforms, but can they do it?
- Studies exist on "determinants of winning court cases" and not on "court decisions", current research about that is usually case-specific!
- Chapter 1 focuses on two views $\rightarrow$ theoretical case studies haven't examined controversial areas, and there is little evidence/focus on individual cases don't generate larger hypotheses

### Structural Constraints

- "Constrained Court" because limited nature of constitutional rights, lack of judicial independence, judiciary's inability to develop policy/lack of implementation power

#### Limited Nature of Rights

- Judicial discretion is bound by norms and expectations of legal culture $\rightarrow$ problem because most litigation based on constitution is about "rights being denied"
- Four important consequences for social reform
  - 1---Limits claims for social reform goals because of their relation to constitutional rights
    - No rights to decent housing, welfare, clean air, etc. $\rightarrow$ practical things go beyond the scope of the court
    - If you can't hear a claim, you can't create reform around it!
  - 2---social reformers have to argue for the establishment of a new right! $\rightarrow$ ex. welfare, court needs to read the Constitution in an expansive/"liberal" way
    - Judges tend to be more "risk averse" and will be more conservative with their readings since it impacts a lot of people
    - "Continuity scripts of law" $\rightarrow$ a judge must plod rather than soar, proceed at the pace of a tortoise, they are unlikely to act as crusaders
  - 3---lots of legal barriers to presenting class actions, and prevents social agencies from using their best arguments $\rightarrow$ social justice =/= legal requirement
    - "More directed toward symptons than causes" $\rightarrow$ litigation doesn't deal with underlying problems
  - 4---technical nature of legal arguments prevents their "political and widespread appeal" $\rightarrow$ there is danger that litigation of a few will replace policy action and reduce democracy!
    - Legal tactics can absorb scarce resources use for popular mobilization

#### Limits on Judicial Independence---The Institutional Factor

- Courts seem important for reform when there's stalemate in other branches $\rightarrow$ they are effective only when they're insulated
  - 1---appointment process (somewhat responsible for political interests of appointee)
  - 2---judicial decisions often "blaze their own path"
  - 3---Congress constrains court action (1. override decisions, 2. courts cannot be independent of other branches "court-packing")
    - Solicitor general, governments can select which cases the courts hear, they don't think they can be constrained

#### Implementation and Institutional Relations

- Courts also lack tools to implement policies! $\rightarrow$ "no influence over the sword of the purse"
  - If courts issue a ruling, it's on "good will" for that decision to be supported and implemented 
  - Heavily dependent on popular support for pressure to enact their decisions! $\rightarrow$ but, the American public doesn't know wtf is going on in the courts
- If they institute sweeping social reform, there will be opposition which means lack of elite and public support needed for "implementation"
- The hierarchical system of the courts is not actually hierarchical $\rightarrow$ lower courts have a lot of discretion and can just not implement something
  - Courts also have no specialization $\rightarrow$ a lot of lower level courts/clerks jump from field to field dependeing on cases
  - Also, people have to approach you with suits instead of litigating by yourself, follow-up is hard because there has to be a pattern of non-enforcement
- Decentralized court system = hard to do social reform!
  - Lower court judges might also just misinterpret stuff and do weird implementations
  - Lots of litigation in courts makes it hard to navigate for large social reforms
  - Hard to make a coherent legal strategy because there's so much stuff!
  - Lower-court people and even some federal court people are less likely to do social reform if the community is opposed to it 
- Opportunity to delay $\rightarrow$ court/legal processes make it really easy to delay things
- Also, no power of the purse! $\rightarrow$ judges can't really force expenditure so there's not much they can do if those programs require a large money backing
- Institutions are "too complex" to be guided by court order $\rightarrow$ also, without backing of politicians, administrators/staff are unlikely to act!
- <u>Summary of Argument</u>: no tools to gain understanding of intricacy of reform + no tools for enforcement of these reforms!
- Judges aren't "trained" $\rightarrow$ they are not penologists/people with expertise, judges are only familiar within their own bubble
  - They also can't provide "effective" long-term planning and monitoring of these cases, since each court case is usually one-off
- Courts also don't want the "smoke" $\rightarrow$ unwilling to take heat from politically unpopular rulings, oftentimes it's just a "teasing illusion" of reform

### Court Effectiveness: The Logic of the Dynamic Court View

#### Overview

- Two main difficulties with the Constrained Court View
  - 1---Overstates the limits on the courts (courts have been very active recently)
  - 2---Courts are "unlikely to", not impossible for them to do social reform!
- Dynamic Court View: courts as not as constrained as people might think, and they can oftentimes be more effective than other government institutions

#### Political, Institutional, Economic Independence

- Courts are free from electornal constraints + institutional arrangements that make change difficult
  - Examples include Civil Rights 1950s, school desegregation
- Insulation, institutional inertia from routinized procedures make it difficult to enact change in other branches, that's not part of the courts!
  - Courts are the "willing force of change" $\rightarrow$ independent from relationships with elected officials, interest groups, financial backers, etc.
- Access and influence is privy to the courts, not dependent on political position (anyone with a good legal argument can convince a judge)
  - Professional lobbying for regular politics is oftentimes too inaccessible, not the case for courts!
  - Best hope to poor, powerless groups!
- Judicial process of discovery can help bring something to light $\rightarrow$ prevents the witholding of evidence, also they have to ground their stuff in "legal arguments" $\rightarrow$ not the way they feel!

#### Courts as Catalysts: Indirect Effects of the Dynamic Court

- Courts aren't partisan! $\rightarrow$ have the "capacity to applea to man's better nature"
  - Courts serve as the catalyst for change! Can put pressure on elites to act, bring attention to legislative issues!
  - Courts can mobilize groups to take action (ex. civil + women's rights) -- also huge benefit is media coverage!
  - Courts can also facilitate negotiations, neutral forum where parties can work out their differences (instead of the complicated + expensive lawsuit) $\rightarrow$ it gets people to the bargaining table

#### Evolving Procedures

- Special masters are appointed to "fill in the courts structural weaknesses"
  - Their role: talk with interested parties, hold hearings, conduct investigations, and help the judge out!
- Other procedures – retention of jurisdiction, creation of monitoring commissions, active engagement of the judge! $\rightarrow$ helps beef up the implementation process

#### Empirical Support

- In terms of education, many criticisms of judges inability to reform are false!
  - Same thing for debtors + tenants and complex institutions
- Basic compliance with court order is way more prevelant that "intentional/unintentional noncompliance"
  - Courts seemed better to handle the educational stuff than state legislatures
- Courts are "unconstrained by bureaucratic intertia in the other branches"

#### Empirical Problems

- However, these studies don't really validate/help construct hypotheses about Court effectiveness in producing social reform!
  - Many studies are theoretical instead of empirical!
- Lots of problems with the studies
  - Hothschild: picked a short + unrepresentative four-year period
  - Cavanagh and Sarat: pick cases that don't address issue of courts reforming institutions (focused on individuals in complex situations!)
- Lots of these court reforms were about "less controversial things" $\rightarrow$ stuff that didn't require overhaul of an entire institution
- <u>Conclusion</u>: Dynamic Court view doesn't do well in understanding the conditions for this action to be effective!

#### Conditions for Court Efficacy

- Hypotheses: constraints of the Constrained Court view limits courts: but the social, political, and economic conditions supporting change can produce significant social reform!
  - Social reform is gradual $\rightarrow$ winning cases is super important!
- Change is gradual, big reforms in litigation will lose!
- Overcoming "stepping away from political mainstream" $\rightarrow$ can be overcome when there is political support
  - i.e. Legislation is passed, courts are asked to interpret it!
  - i.e. Executive branch is supportive of reformers...or Congress is *seriously* considering stuff
- Most difficult constraint to overcome: no enforcement!
  - Courts may be effective producers of social reform when their decisions are announced in a political context of the broad elite/popular support
- However, that's not enough––you also need certain conditions:
  - 1---incentives are offered with decision, some reward is offered with implementation (i.e. Congress gives money to states/institutions that enforce court decisions)
    - Actions of private parties (developers move to new areas with court upholding)
    - Reverse side of money $\rightarrow$ decrease costs!
  - 2---decisions can be implemented through the market $\rightarrow$ individuals can create their own institutions to implement court decisions 
  - 3---when officials use court orders as a tool for leveraging additional resources, also they can use the image of violating a court order to coerce things!
  - 4---Shield/cover for political reaction, you can implement required reforms and protest against them $\rightarrow$ shift responsbility onto the courts!
- If Constraints I and II and III are overcome + one of the conditions is present, then you can do social reform!

## Chapter 1

### Introduction

- Brown vs Board of Education serves as the "pinnacle" of Courts producing social change!
  - Dynamic Court: this was the catalyst for social change
  - Constrained Court: this was the product of a changing social tide!
- Without Brown, there might not have been other landmark Civil Rights cases!

## Chapter 2

## Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools

### Court Action

- Brown + Bolling vs. Sharpe = courts first questions into segregation in elementary + secondary schools
  - Context: 17 states still maintained segregated elementary + secondary schools by law! (21 total required/allowed segregated schools)
- 1 Year later, courts issued a warning to lower courts that they were to take action to prevent discimination in schools!
- Supreme Court stood strong and reversed lower court decisions about it --- then, Cooper vs. Aaron
  - Could not delay the desegregation of the schooling for "violence" $\rightarrow$ was told to immediately desegregate! (law of the land)
- Then, Goss vs. Board of Education Knoxville
  - One-way trasnfer plan based on race was illegal!
- Then, Griffin vs. Prince Edward County
  - You can't close down a public school on grounds of desegregation, can't use federal funds for segregated private education!
- After 1964 Civil Rights Act (CRA), Supreme Court was quiet in education
  - Lots of lower-level federal courts held up desegregation guidelines and other related things
  - "All deliberate speed" for desegregation is a requirement! Lots of appeals to delay!

#### Congressional and Executive Branch Action

- Congress
  - Congress passed meh CRA in 1957 and 1960! (very weak legislation because there was nothing allowed for enforcement)
  - 1964 CRA was sweeping!
    - Education: attorney general can bring desegregation suits on behalf of individuals (Title VI means that you can cut off funding to schools who don't comply)
- Executive (highlighted in a later chapter)
- Back to Congress
  - ESEA (Elementary + Secondary Education Act) $\rightarrow$ HEW, with the power of Court upholdings, required complete desegregation
  - Federal government arm-twisted over 3000 districts!

#### Results and Comparison

- Courts spoke forcefully while Congress did little, CRA and ESEA gave them tools for enforcement
- Supreme Court had important impact on school desegregation in six border states + DC
  - 1964 CRA increased rate of desegregation!
- Supreme Court didn't really do much in the Southern states, entrance of Congress + executive changed this!
  - Courts seem to be important from 1968-72 but not in the 10 years following Brown

#### Higher Education

- 1---Court chipped away in a number of cases challenging segregation in graduate + professional education (Missouri ex. rel. Gaines v. Canada) (McLaurin v Oklahoma Board of Regents)
- President Kennedy + Eisenhower didn't do anything basically! CRA came around and let executive branch cut off federal funds to institutions that segregated
  - OCR (Office of Civil Rights) didn't really enforce it though!
  - Adams v Richardson put pressure on the OCR to enforce desegregation!

#### Results and Comparison

- Congress + Executive branch, not the Court who brought some desegregation to higher education!

### Voting

#### Court Action

- Supreme Court Texas primary cases (Nixon vs Herndon) $\rightarrow$ Texas democratic party upheld a membership clause to exclude black people
- Court did strike down other attempts to disenfranchise black voters $\rightarrow$ consistently (one aside) held up right of Black people to take part in electoral process

#### Congressional + Executive Branch Action

- Executive + Congress did NOTHING! (per usual)...1957 - Congress did something useful, 1960 - Civil Rights enforced!
  - Courts were a vital part of the "un-disenfranchisement" process for Black voters
  - 1965 Voting Rights Act - direct federal action for black voters! (people were sent to election districts)
- Kennedy used the voting acts a little bit to sue, Eisenhower basically left them untouched though

#### Results and Comparison

- Until 1957, Court acted alone $\rightarrow$ joined by other branches later, but not excitingly!
  - Courts helped a little, but there were also other important societal changes that were taking place that definitely also affected registration!
- There was definitely true that the 1965 VRA helped! $\rightarrow$ actions of the Court contributed very little, mostly it was due to Congress + executive!

### Other Sectors

- **Transportation:** not result of court action, but of the action of the other branches of the government
  - Court had Mitchell vs US $\rightarrow$ Henderson, segregatino in transport was eventualyl prohibited
  - Congress didn't act, it was mostly the ICC 
- **Accomodations + Public Places:** Court did not speak directly, Court action was ineffective --- only when Congress acted
  - Actions of all branches were limited, but a series of cases following Brown made it clear that this was to extend to Public areas
- **Housing:** Court decisions resulted in no appreciable change in housing discrimination
  - Courts made it clear that state action in support of housing discrimination would be struck down, banned restrictive covenants but didn't speak out much (supported open housing)
  - Congress + Executive - Title VIII which prevented racial discrimination on housing, but not much action in terms of historical precedent

### Conclusion

- Before Congress + Executive branch acted, courts had no direct effect on ending discimination in keys fields (education, voting, transportation, accommodation, housing)
- Brown is a paradigm, but for the opposite view $\rightarrow$ because they do not produce significant social reform without the other branches!
