# [9/3] Environmental Federalism

#### Introduction

- Trump is rolling back environmental regulations and recalibrating American federalism
- Withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement for "financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country" and that it did not impose "meaningful obligations on the worlds largest polluters"
- Trump also signaled that he wants to rescind Obama CPP (clean power plan) and other efforts to match Paris $\rightarrow$ efforts also will reignite the coal industry!
- Wants to change power of the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and other federal agencies that had "over-reached" during the Obama Presidency
- Article has a focus on climate change mitigation and water quality protection management 
- The move is important because of environmental federalism that would shift more responsibility to state governments
- Author's take is that reorienting environmental policy through the use of administrative tools rather than legislation is a tenuous strategy for achieving long-term change (Trump may be ineffective in the long-run)

#### Cooperative Federalism

- Scott Pruit (EPA director under Trump) $\rightarrow$ identified "cooperative federalism" along with the “rule of law” and “public participation" as three core policies
  - States should be our nation’s frontline environmental implementers and enforcers

##### Environmental Federalism in Context

- Federalism $\rightarrow$ should states or the federal government take a leading role
- Federal better:
  - "Race to bottom" $\rightarrow$ people will just move to lower cost states and people will keep loosening regulations
  - Spillovers, economices of scale
- States better:
  - One-size-fit-all doesn't work
  - States are more knowledgeable about their individual needs $\rightarrow$ and it could inspire a wave of states improving their stuff
  - Policy experimentation and innovation!
- Democrats favor national control, Republicans favor state
- Structure of this is that EPA sets national standards and authorizes state governments to implement federal programs
  - Clean Air, Clean Water, Safe Drinking Water
  - 96% of these programs have been delegated to the states
- Cooperative federalism is collaborative, and requires high levels of intergovernmental trust
  - Obama shifted authority from states back to federal government
  - Bush had a period of more state-led reforms
  - States can also be different based on the way they view federal programs and things (texas vs California and EPA)

##### Pruitt's Federalism Agenda

- Less federal stuff, he also has a history of being focused on federalism (replaced an environmental governmental office in Oklahoma with federalism task force)
- Sued EPA on behalf of Oklahoma more than 12 times
  - Part of a "strikeforce" to challenge the EPA during Obama
- Sued CPP on the grounds that it was a threat to "reliability and affordability of power"
- Trump's actions
  - EPA, DOI, and other agencies have initiated comprehensive rollback of federal rules and new ones implemented
    - Used the CRA (Congressional Review Act) which allows any regulation by a federal agency to be overturned by a majority vote in both chambers
      - Transparency rule about Exxon and Chevron to disclose taxes and other payments
      - Surface Mining stream protection rule
      - Hunting laws in Alaska
  - Working closer with states
- CRA use $\rightarrow$ might be difficult to repass those laws since the CRA prohibits something like that "substantively similar"
- Pruitt actions
  - Delayed implementation (delaying deadlines for companies and governments to meet federal guidelines)
    - Some of these have been challenged and have run into obstacles in court so the delays have been ineffective.
- More actions: Rescind two other rules
  - CPP (Obama) and Waters of the US rule
  - Promises to also revisit fuel efficiency, coal disposal, and emission rules for other stuff
- Trump has not advocated for any major legislation related to the environment and not signaled for any "to come"
  - XO 13771: Identify 2 regulations to repeal for every regulation proposed + regulatory budget (new regulations = 0 cost)
  - XO 13777: "regulatory reform task force"
  - Environmental enforcement also weaker (less civil cases settled + less fines paid)
  - Also, EPA enforcers apparently can't access certain tests anymore without federal approval (less tests = less strict things)
- Giving power back to states
  - "Back to Basics" Agenda
    - Focus on "enhacing economic growth" $\rightarrow$ Waters of the US rule
  - 2018-2022 EPA strategic plan
    - Detailed document that shifts responsibility back to the state
  - Huge budget cut to the EPA (31% decrease in spending) but also decreased/cut funding to the states

##### Continued Reliance on Administrative Presidency

- Republicans weaken environmental protection laws, Democrats strengthen!
- EPA repealed the CPP (Obama-era initiative regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants)
  - CPP is not gone, has to go through regular rulemaking process before finalized (replacement rule will be incoming tho)
  - There will most likely be another bill $\rightarrow$ EPA is in the job of regulating greenhouse gas emissions if they are harmful (and they are lol)
    - People are arguing that section 111(d) already regulates mercury pollution
    - EPA will argue that the CPP is overstepping is legal mandate (making decisions that would more power production away from coal), you can only regulate existing power plants
      - Probably will be tied in litigation for a long time
- Utility companies need to prepare $\rightarrow$ facing period of uncertainty and may need to invest in better infrastructure
  - Market forces are supporting green energy
    - Emissions will fall 27-35% estimated
  - Next president might re-instate the CPP
- US Climate Alliance $\rightarrow$ bi-partisan group of states that have committed to achieving CPP and upholding Paris Climate Accord
  - CPP is not enough $\rightarrow$ only accounts for the quarter of necessary reductions
  - And even then, Paris may not be enough to avoid the worst of climate change
    - Revocation of the CPP can also signal to other countries that US isn't serious $\rightarrow$ spillover effect to negatively impact global climate

##### Redefining the Waters of the US

- Trump wants to reconsider to the WOTUS rule, want to revoke it!
  - Clean Water act $\rightarrow$ gives authority to regulate pollution into (and something to do with dredging and filling) "navigable waters"
    - The problem is that we can't define which waters are included
  - Supreme court cases made this even more confusing and Obama wanted to clarify (cover streams and stuff adjacent to navigable waterways) $\rightarrow$ 60% of bodies of water
    - Was met with a bunch of real estate, agricultural, industrial resistance
- Trump wants to replace it with another rule, this could lose protection for 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands (including drinking water stuff)
  - Lots of state action regarding challenging the rules in court!
- 20 states have sued the EPA to stop CPP, 31 states have joined various lawsuits against WOTUS (partisan policies of attorney general)
- State involvement is also in offshore drilling for oil and natural gas
  - DOI said it would permit oil and gas drilling in off shore waters, this is a reversal of ban set by Obama
- There will definitely be a lot of legal drama (Trump is trying to scale back reforms on certain national monuments)

##### A Preliminary Assessment

- Trump has been very strategic and quite effective when it comes to climate policy $\rightarrow$ President Trump has actually followed through on promises made
  - Policy retrenchment: deregulation of stuff, no new policies
  - Role of States has increased $\uparrow$ 
- States will have additional discretion to decide how they want to pursue environmental protection, exacerbate different federal policies
  - California and NY will likely increase regulations, and some states have began to either unravel or follow suit with states like California
- Federal policy retrenchment + state response $\rightarrow$ change nature of environmental federalism
- Even though changes look severe, it's pretty normal in the ebb and flow of environmental policy across the last 40 years
