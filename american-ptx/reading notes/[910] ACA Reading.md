# [9/10] American PTX Reading

## The ACA: Victory of Unorthodox Lawmaking

#### Abstract

- Law encourages universal health care coverate through competition among private insurance companies
- Democratic majority using Clinton initiative and Republican's strategy of using strong Congressional leadership, was able to overcome institutional constraints that made change hard
- Law created pooling mechanisms $\rightarrow$ where individual companies can compete with each other to offer healthcare
- Clinton's policy: employers either cover their employees or pay a tax to the government 
- It was believed prior to the ACA that healthcare reform was impossible $\rightarrow$ only incremental reform is possible
- Lots of signs pointed to failure: strong budget constraints + fiscal pressure on government
  - Answer was "increased cohension among Democrats", "powerful vetoes" which helped this bill pass (however, this is not the main focus of the article)
- The article analyzes the legislative process of reform and explains it as "an evolution of American institutions becoming more centralized, more party-driven, and more legislative process"
  - Qualitative consideration of reform's political process, focuses on institutions and their role on decision makers/policy options
- Democrats were able to overcome "unorthodox lawmaking" (opposition from internal party moderates) and overcome some of the veto players

**Claim:** Party polarization weakens ability of legislators to have large agendas, but it also makes sure that majorities can pass bills easier - Increased institutional tools for parties (shifted power within legislative institution), Veto people have been weakened, positive collective actor (leadership of both parties) has emerged

#### Logic of Change in Fragmented Regime of SOP

- Executive-based institutions have more power/suave to enact reforms
  - Legislature is fragmented, also known as the "broken branch" since there is lots of gridlock and stalling that happens
  - "Window of opportunity" appeared in 2009-2010, with a Democratic majority into Congress + Obama to the White House
- Window of Opportunity Thesis (she disagrees with this)
  - Economic situation is good for healthcare reform (it's complicated though)
  - Degradation of Health Care system made it so that a lot of Americans supported healthcare reform! (they also passed the bill with wavering public support later in the process)
  - Support of reform from major stakeholders (who were opposed in the past)
    - Employers supported since healthcare became more expensive post-recession
    - Hospitals wanted reform because they have more insured patients and reduce that cost of burden
    - Doctor's joined because of some cut in their Medicaire rates (AMA made this happen)
  - Insurance companies (who opposed Obama) also supported the reform $\rightarrow$ more healthy clients?
  - Liberals also dominated more of the Democratic party and they removed the filibuster with an extra seat
- However, window of opportunity theory is not enough - these were all present in 1993 under Clinton!
  - Unified conservative opposition to healthcare policy $\rightarrow$ but Democrats made a lot of concessions the second time around
    - People were willing to abandon parts of the bill to make it happen
- Two considerations are in effect: 1) Learning from Clinton's failure 2) building off of Republican success to passing healthcare reforms

- Why 1993 Failed?
  - Too secret, leaks from behind closed doors, slowness and not negogiating with Congress earlier gridlocked and killed the project
  - Obama was less involved (he did created the Office of Health Care Reform) and sent "general guidelines" and put the burden of negotiation on Congress
    - People still complained that it wasn't enough though and that involvement from President would've been helpful
- Response in 2010 $\rightarrow$ negotiations with health care stakeholders caused Democrats to let go of more liberal options for reform
  - It became slowly and slowy more moderate $\rightarrow$ individual mandate instead of employer mandate, state-based exchanges instead of federal health exchange
- Pragmatism is a big thing $\rightarrow$ this is key to unify a somewhat divided Democratic ideology (Blue Dog democrats...moderates)
  - Centralization in the House and Senate (with committees) was also a significant factor in the bill's success
  - "Unorthodox Lawmaking"
    - Consideration of one bill by several committees
    - Bypassing committee examination
    - Making substantive changes by merging committee bills
    - Increased use of omnibus measures for large-scale reform
    - Increase number of formal/informal summits between Pres + Congress
    - Using complex + restrictive floor rules

#### What is Unorthodox Lawmaking?

- As a term, refers to changes in the institutional logic of Congress work
  - Side-effect is reducing the power of veto players
- Strengthening of parties in Congress $\rightarrow$ increase incentives for party loyalty
  - Allignment with party practices gives party leadership more legitimacy to influence standing committees
  - Influence committee assignments and nominate committee chairs
- Speaker of the House becomes the driving force in the Rules Committee
  - Decline in seniority rule in assigning commitee chairmanship
  - You can use committee leadership as a reward for party loyalty
- Party contributions for re-election now play a big role, people want to get re-elected so they will align their policies to guarantee funding
  - Parties also recruit candidates for election - so people want to work within the party and be attentive to their recommendations
- Budgets $\uparrow$ so we also know that experts hired on these committees are often good at publishing results beneficial to certain parties
  - Parties guarantee cohesion in debates + public sphere $\rightarrow$ they tell you what to say

#### Building on Republic Precedent of Strong Leadership

- Gingrich was a big player in centralizing of parties - prior to 2010 (there were 12 years of Republican Majority), and the tactics used by Democrats were taken from the Republican playbook
- 2010 was different - instead of fighting among committees, we see a drive to merge bills from the beginning and communication among committees
  - Negotiations with stakeholders occured in the Speaker's office!
  - Speaker had to convince liberals to support bills that they worried were "not comprehensive enough"
- Bipartisanship sometimes is too difficult, so it was ignored $\rightarrow$ huge problems with insurance reform (assistance, individual mandate, employer responsibility)
  - Instead of formal conference committees to reconcile differences, they're summoned to White House to work out differences
  - Used some controversial way to pass House Amendments (which is how they reconciled differences post no-filibuster)

#### Conclusion

- Reform is about compromise now? Healthcare is defined by dual and conflicting goals of expanding coverage and decreasing costs
- This bill signals the government's commitment to healthcare! $\rightarrow$ government takeover of healthcare
- Harsh partisanship is the result of the topic controversy and also the new unorthodox way of Congress in Parliament
- 2 ways that Democrats took advantage of the "window of opportunity"
  - Better reform program after 1994 defeat
  - Changes in rules of the legislative process
