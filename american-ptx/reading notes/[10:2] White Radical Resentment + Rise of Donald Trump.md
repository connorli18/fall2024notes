# [10/2] White Radical Resentment + Rise of Donald Trump

#### Overview

- Surprise and Contradiction of Political Expectations:

  - Trump's rise shocked political experts who initially gave him little chance.

  - His success contradicted the "party decides" theory, which emphasizes party elites shaping primary outcomes.

- Economic Discontent Theory:

  - Some argue Trump’s success was due to economic frustrations among white, working-class voters.

  - Exit polls show support from both less-educated voters and wealthier, educated Republicans, limiting this theory's explanatory power.

- White Racial Resentment as Key Factor:

  - Trump’s appeal largely stemmed from stoking racial fear and resentment.
    - Attacks on Mexican immigrants, promises to build a border wall, and calls for mass deportation.
    - Calls for a ban on Muslim immigration and promoting false claims about Muslim celebrations after 9/11.

  - Promoted white supremacist messages and conspiracy theories, such as birtherism.

- Racial Messaging Resonated with GOP Voters:

  - Exit polls show strong support from Republicans who favored deportations and banning Muslims.

  - His campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again," signaled a return to an era of white dominance.

#### Racial Realignment: The Growth of White Racial Resentment

### Overview of "White Racial Resentment and the Rise of Donald Trump" (Extended)

- Exit Polls on Racial Resentment:
  - Racial resentment and fear were critical factors in Trump’s success among Republican primary voters.
  - While Trump's proposals like deporting undocumented immigrants and banning Muslims were unpopular with the general electorate, they resonated strongly with Republican voters.
  - A Pew Research poll (August 2016) showed:
    - 61% of Americans opposed Trump’s border wall, while 36% supported it.
    - Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents: 84% opposed, 14% supported.
    - Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents: 63% supported, 34% opposed.

- Historical Context – Racial Realignment:
  - Trump's rise can be linked to a broader racial realignment that began in the 1970s.
  - Republican candidates had long used racially charged messages (e.g., African-American crime, forced busing, affirmative action) to appeal to white Democrats, particularly in the South.
  - This strategy helped Republicans win presidential elections from Nixon to George W. Bush and turned the South from a Democratic to a Republican stronghold.

- Racial and Ideological Party Realignment:
  - From the 1970s to the 2000s, there was a shift in the racial and ideological bases of the major parties.
  - National exit polls (1976-2012) show:
    - The nonwhite percentage of Democratic voters steadily increased, while the nonwhite share of Republican voters remained low, peaking at 12% in 2004 and declining to 10% by 2012.
    - By 2012, 45% of Democratic voters were nonwhite, while only 10% of Republican voters were nonwhite.
    - Obama lost the white vote by 20 points in 2012 but won the election due to overwhelming nonwhite support (82% to 16%).

- Two Phases of Racial Realignment:
  - Phase 1 (1976-1992):
    - African-Americans formed the majority of nonwhite voters.
    - Nonwhite share of Republican voters remained at 4%, and the nonwhite share of Democratic voters varied by candidate appeal to white voters.
  - Phase 2 (1992-2012):
    - Large-scale immigration from Latin America and Asia, along with higher fertility rates among nonwhite populations, dramatically increased the nonwhite share of voters.
    - The Republican nonwhite voter share increased to 12% in 2004, then declined to 10% by 2008 and 2012, while the Democratic nonwhite share rose to 45% by 2012.

- Impact of Racial Resentment:
  - As the U.S. electorate became more diverse, many white voters increasingly felt threatened by the loss of their dominant status in society and politics.
  - ANES (American National Election Studies) data shows rising racial resentment among white voters between the Reagan and Obama eras:
    - The percentage of white voters scoring high on the racial resentment scale increased from 42% during Reagan-Bush to 51% during Obama’s presidency.
    - Racial resentment increased significantly among white Republicans, rising from 44% in the Reagan-Bush era to 64% in the Obama years.
    - Racial resentment among white Democrats decreased slightly during this period, creating a significant partisan gap by 2008.

- Racial Resentment and Party Alignment:
  - The racial resentment divide between white Democrats and Republicans grew sharply during this time, fueled by the increasing visibility of African-Americans and other nonwhite groups within the Democratic Party.
  - This divide was also driven by Republican strategies to appeal to racially conservative white voters by portraying Democrats as favoring minorities over whites.

- Key Role in Trump’s Success:
  - By the time of the 2016 election, racial resentment was pervasive among Republican voters, creating fertile ground for Trump’s racially charged messages.
  - The strong correlation between racial attitudes and partisan alignment made it easier for Trump, who focused heavily on white racial resentment, to secure the Republican nomination.

#### Barack Obama, White Racial Resentment (2008 Election)

### Overview of "Racial Resentment and the 2008 Election"

- Obama's 2008 Candidacy and Racial Resentment:
  - Obama’s candidacy in 2008 raised the prominence of racial issues in the election.
  - Even though racial issues were not overtly discussed, the presence of a viable African-American candidate brought racial resentment into play.
  - Data from the 2008 ANES (American National Election Study) shows a strong link between racial resentment and white Democratic voters' preferences in the primaries.
  
- Influence of Racial Resentment in the Democratic Primaries:
  - Racial resentment had a significant impact on candidate preference:
    - 74% of white Democrats with low racial resentment voted for Obama.
    - Only 26% of those with high racial resentment voted for Obama, while 74% supported Clinton.
  - Other factors like education and ideology were also related to candidate preference, but racial resentment was the strongest predictor in multivariate analysis.

- Racial Resentment in the 2008 General Election:
  - Racial resentment influenced the general election vote as well, despite partisanship being the most important factor.
  - Among white Democrats:
    - Low racial resentment voters overwhelmingly supported Obama (97%).
    - High racial resentment voters showed more partisan defection, with only 82% voting for Obama.
  - Among white Republicans:
    - Low racial resentment voters were more likely to defect and vote for Obama (25%).
    - High racial resentment voters strongly favored McCain (94%).

- Logistic Regression Analysis of the 2008 Vote:
  - After controlling for factors like party identification, ideology, age, education, and gender, racial resentment was still a significant predictor of vote choice.
    - Party identification was the strongest predictor.
    - Racial resentment had a stronger direct influence than ideology, highlighting the impact of Obama being the first African-American major party nominee.
  - In previous elections (1988-2004), racial resentment did not have a significant influence on vote choice after accounting for party identification and ideology.

#### White Racial Resentment (2016 Republican Primary)

### Overview of "Racial Resentment and the 2016 Republican Primaries"

- Racial Resentment's Role in Primary Elections:
  - In general elections, partisanship usually dominates voting behavior, but in primaries, other factors like racial resentment play a larger role.
  - The 2016 Republican primaries provided a clear test of racial resentment’s influence due to Trump’s reliance on appeals to white racial resentment.

- ANES 2016 Pilot Study:
  - Conducted in late January 2016, before the Iowa caucuses, the ANES Pilot Study surveyed 1,200 voting-age adults.
  - Included a four-item racial resentment scale, allowing comparison with earlier ANES surveys.
  - The divide between white Democrats and Republicans on racial resentment was the largest in ANES history:
    - 69% of white Republicans scored high in racial resentment (up from 64% in 2008).
    - 19% of white Democrats scored high, a significant drop from 33% in 2008.

- Rise of Racial Resentment Among Republicans:
  - The increase in racial resentment among white Republicans during Obama’s presidency set the stage for Trump’s rise as the frontrunner.
  - By January 2016, Trump led the Republican field with 40% of registered Republican support.
    - Ted Cruz (14%), Marco Rubio (12%), and Ben Carson (9%) followed.
  - Trump led among white Republicans (44% to Cruz's 15%) but only garnered 19% support among nonwhite Republicans.

- Racial Resentment and Trump Support:
  - A strong correlation existed between racial resentment and support for Trump:
    - Among white Republicans with low racial resentment, fewer than 30% supported Trump.
    - Among those with high racial resentment, 65% supported Trump.
  
- Logistic Regression Analysis:
  - A logistic regression analysis showed racial resentment had the strongest influence on support for Trump, more than any other factor:
    - Racial resentment had the highest t-ratio (4.09) and was statistically significant (p = .001).
    - Economic conservatism had a weaker effect, with less conservative Republicans more likely to support Trump, potentially due to his support for federal programs like Social Security and Medicare.
    - Opposition to trade had little effect on Trump support, despite his anti-trade rhetoric.
    - Social class indicators like education and income had minimal influence, with education nearing significance (p = .10), but these factors were mediated by racial resentment.
  
- Key Takeaway:
  - Racial resentment was the most powerful predictor of support for Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries, far outweighing factors like economic conservatism, trade opposition, or social class. Less-educated and lower-income voters were more likely to support Trump mainly due to higher levels of racial resentment.

#### It Really Was (Mostly) About Race

### Conclusion Notes on "White Racial Resentment and Trump’s 2016 Victory"

- Trump’s 2016 Victory as a Shock:
  - Trump’s nomination defied traditional political theories, which suggested party elites controlled voter preferences.
  - His success reflected deep changes within the Republican electoral coalition, similar to how Obama’s 2008 victory reflected changes in the Democratic coalition.

- Rise of Racial Resentment:
