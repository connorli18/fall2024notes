# [9/18] Elites - Class Notes

### Session 1

- 3 kinds of borders related to dominant positions
  - Nationality 
  - Race
  - Gender
- What is "the nation"?
  - From the American/French Revolution!
    - "Nationality" will move power from king $\rightarrow$ people
    - Pillar of priviledge, you cannot acccess the social system unless you are a citizen!
  - "Nationality" is defined properly!
    - Closure of nationality from migrants (police close the borders)
    - "Immigration" is started to take shape in France in 19th century
  - Introduction of national political parties $\rightarrow$ nationalization of politics
    - Citizenship $\rightarrow$ linked to belonging to a community of people involved in politics (right to vote + connection to nationality)
- [Cameron] Tensions of Empire: colonial culture in a Bourgeois World
  - Colonial encounters are not "one-sided": affected both colonizer and colonized since oftentimes the colonizer gets left out of discussion
  - Modernity + Colonization is connected $\rightarrow$ a lot of modernization was transformed (new materials, etc.)
  - Europe is impacted by its colonial past $\rightarrow$ colonies gaining their independence is oftentimes associated with "uncivilized behavior"
  - Lack of European perspectives, lack of gender discussion, it is not super accessible to the general public
- Pillars of Priviledge
  - Nationality, Citizenship, etc.
  - Universality of rights but for a few (colonial and racial borders) 
    - Colonies don't get the universality of rights, there are still strong divisions between "colonised people" and "citizens"
    - "Subaltern studies" $\rightarrow$ We can't write history from the archives of the colonizers
    - Colonial beauracrats want to "civilize" the local population (used to describe farmers) $\rightarrow$ "civilize the poor neighborhoods" 
    - Algerian Colonization
      - "Blackfeet" (French colonizers who had to flee from Algeria in independence war) and "Redfeet" (French colonizers who supported Algerian independence)
  - Gender and Invisibilisation of women's work $\rightarrow$ a focus on family (marriage and unity supports capture of women's capital), rhetoric of masculinity with a central role played by sports

#### Gender, Race, Class: Colonial Context (Reproduction in the Gold Coast), 1910s-1950s

- Focus: Elite in a colonial context, reform of modernity and motherhood
  - Definition: (modernity and motherhood) Medicalization of reproductive labor $\rightarrow$ pregnancy, childbirth, childcare 
    - Encourage African women to turn to medically-trained staff when they were pregnant/about to give birth, implementation of new norms of motherhood
    - Physiological and the social aspects of motherhood!
- The Gold Coast (1919-1957)
  - Modern day Ghana (1957 independence), referred to in its entirety as "the Gold Coast" colony
    - Exports were mainly gold, palm oil $\rightarrow$ eventually exports became mostly centered around cocao 
      - Cacao buyers decided the prices, so even though farmers owned the land, they were still subjects to capitalism
      - Lots of large cities supported migrant workers from the Northern territories who supported farming
- Dr. Frederick Nanka-Bruce: important figure for modernity and motherhood
  - How is he an elite? What type of elite?
    - Dressed European style, European-style furniture in his house, well-educated in medicine (specifically European trained)
    - Among the elite, traders, journalists, other medically-trained professionals, high-educated individuals, mostly Christians, Anglophiles but hated the racism associated with colonialism
      - Racist regulations in colonialism meant that these elite (that supported colonialism as "natural leaders") $\rightarrow$ could not hold higher positions
      - Started a trend of nationalism (they want more power within the colonial system)
  - Judge Smyly's Farewall Party Pictures
    - Women (15): flappers (1920), female elite! Seems to be an even mix of African women and European women in the picture displayed in the slides
      - Class sometimes trumped race $\rightarrow$ milieu that is combination of wives of colonials 
    - Men (37): less Europeans in the photo, more men than women photographed
      - Lots of men did not bring their wives $\rightarrow$ these wives may not have been part of the social elite, thus, they were not appropriately invited to these events
    - Colonization relied heavily on African men! 
- Prosperity of the 1920s (Governor Guggisberg)
  - As a governor, he was considered "more Enlightened" than other governors and better for race-relations
    - Achimota College, Takoradi Harbour, Korle Bu African Hospital, Maternity Hospital
  - 1911 (1.5 million) $\rightarrow$ 1957 (6 million) $\rightarrow$ 2023 (26 million)
    - "Underpopulated" $\rightarrow$ it is underpopulated relatively to a particular aim or objective! In order to "extract wealth" from a territory, then you need to have an important population
- Maternal and Motherhood
  - Mortality figures
    - Mortality figures are high, $ \frac{4}{10}$ children died before they reached the age of 5
    - Dr. Nanka-Bruce wrote a letter concerning the "underpopulation" of the Gold Coast Colony, specifically talked about puerperal fever and infantile mortality
      - This led to governor appointing committee to figure out the causes of puerperal fever and infantile mortality
      - The result of this study is "mother inaptitude" $\rightarrow$ they blamed mothers and midwives for their incompetence
    - The Response: build a bunch of hospitals, child welfare centres, trained qualified midwives, Accra baby shows (health pagent, healthiest children receive prizes)
      - A more focus on "taking care of your own children" $\rightarrow$ which stopped a phenomena called "the circulation of children"
        - A good mother takes care of your own children, doesn't work outside the house, etc.
