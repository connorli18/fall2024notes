### Session 1

#### Introduction

- Ternary Society $\rightarrow$ transition into a new model based on a new way to justify priviledge
  - Ternary $\rightarrow$ proprietarian society
- Norbert Elias (famous sociologist & author)  
  - Jewish merchant family (studied philosophy and medicine in Breslau)
  - Was at the intersection of 3 famous German sociologists at the time
  - His famous book is not about "The Court Society", it's about "The Civilization Process"
    - "Civility" is an attempt to define "good" behavior
    - Transnational process in Europe in 16th century $\rightarrow$ has to be understood!
- 16th century Europe $\rightarrow$ good manners originally were transmitted through oral tradition, but now, people are interested in "good manners" which is why books about good manners have audiences
  - How can I (not royalty) behave like the son of the king? 
  - If you can write the rule, then people can learn the rule (even if they are not insiders)
    - "You should use a tissue, and turn away from people while sneezing"
  - This is during a time of a decline of nobility/aristocracy and the rising Bourgzoise $\rightarrow$ now there are places for them to interact in Court Society
- 4 processes that are the pillars of this transformation: 
  - Territorial centralization: growing concentration of power (wars, marriages, etc.), building a kingdom with a continuous territory and regrouping more and more lords
    - Administrative form of power (money, armies, etc.) $\rightarrow$ rise of the modern state where the king can manage the whole territory and is in charge of building an administration
    - Differentiation of political and religious roles: (Westphalian Treaty 1648) - religious leadership and political leadership is different! 
  - Increasing specialization of administrative and political roles: Autonomy of the beauracracy (it's not tied to a family or anything else) $\rightarrow$ the winner will have the power of the federal state

#### [Alastair] Court Society

- Court Society: Nobert Elias
- Purpose of the Research: we should focus on social positions instead of individuals, talked about developing the "royal position" and "royal powers"
  - How do we go from overthrown rulers to centralized powers that is more autonomous?
- What is Court Society?
  - House + Household of the King + his dependents (usually smaller, but expands as your power grows)
  - Advancement gained by having access to the court, which is difficult to gain (king gave most of the social positions including de-advancement)
- Development of Courts
  - The Catholic Church was the first to do something related to the "court"
  - France had a Princely Court $\rightarrow$ separated from religion, but the French Court society was the start of the fad where rulers manage the country through the courts
- Centralization of France
  - France started as a confederation of princes $\rightarrow$ royal power was limited and there was very little federal power
  - King was able to centralize power in Paris, royal lords now compete for places at the Royal court $\rightarrow$ instead of contesting the King's federal-ish power
- Elites of Court Society
  - "House prestige" is a defining feature, estates over economics $\rightarrow$ upkeep of the social standing, lifestyle, and standard of living defined their power!
  - Bourgeois society were not part of the court, but they could be "guests"/have a limited role,
  - Court Society Houses $\rightarrow$ very important to meetings, accomodations, social functions, and were very extravagant to impress people and show "high lifestyle"
- Role of Servants
  - The servants were very important because they would care for the elites $\rightarrow$ create the same standard of living for the elites and there was a very clear social hierarchy
- The Good Society
  - The other upper classes surrounding the Court Society that were not necessarily part of the "court"
  - Also, there is competition for status (increasing bourgeois wealth is a concern for court nobles) $\rightarrow$ especially because oftentimes the court nobles borrowed lots of money

#### Court Society

- "What are the constraints on the King in Court Society?"
  - Court put a lot of scrutiny on the King (and had to behave accordingly) $\rightarrow$ his power is contingent on his good behavior/alignment with the society
- Definition/Basic Notes
  - Political competition is becoming peaceful? $\rightarrow$ if you aren't in court society, you are against the king! (you live in Versailles if you legitimize the rule of the king)
  - King can borrow and get money from anyone, you can convince them that you will give back this money! $\rightarrow$ the solution is an Office of Titles, where you can buy position into this new administrative body
- All power is centered around the king $\rightarrow$ if you are loved by the king and you are invited to his work, then you have power and you can help him!
- Rank given by noble titles: duke, marquis, count, baron, knight
  - Your proximity/relation to the king defines the importance of your title both by "money" and by "blood"
- Express anger/emotions in a "smart way", rules about the expression of violence!
  - Control + delay revenge, it is a matter of honour!
  - Duel is an act of violence "allowed" by the protocol $\rightarrow$ you will not provoke a duel with someone lower than you!
    - You need to recruit a witness to discuss weapons, times, rules, etc.
  - You can also outsmart them, if you best them in a game of wits/intellect (using your words)
- Movies: Baron Lyon, Ridicule (about Court Society)

### Session 2

#### [Lihi] Mozart

- Mozart: Portrait of a Genius, Robert Elias
- Failed at two of his goals in life (which is what may have been so devastating and accelerated his death):
  - "Success in Vienna"
  - "Failing in gaining love from society around him and his wife"
- Mozart's father wants his son to be part of the court society $\rightarrow$ wants to be a freelancer artists, not a court artist (leave to Vienna from Salzburg)
  - Dual identity $\rightarrow$ Mozart wanted to be treated as an equal based on music + achievement
- Mozart started a movement for the democratiziation of society $\rightarrow$ first to start and gain momentum for the freelance artistry things
- "The Process of Sublimation" (social expectation vs. raw desires and stuff $\rightarrow$ creative fantasties are transformed into something socially acceptable)
- "Fantasy-streams" $\rightarrow$ impulses of conscience for some level of social acceptability
- Court Society + Mozart $\rightarrow$ case study of how artists in this phase were experiencing their lives as part of the court (musicians were servants to the court?)
  - Mozart knew he was genius but he was trying to break free from the social structure

#### Art and Court Society

- "Manet" - Pierre Bourdieu (French socioligist) written similar to Mozart about Manet (painting and not music)

$$
\begin{align*}
x^{x^{x^{x^{\dots}}}} &= 2\\
x^2 &= 2\\
x &= 2
\end{align*}
$$

- Learn how to "paint a king" $\rightarrow$ type of art that is co-produced by the state!
  - You have to represent the King well, and you are trained to paint the king in a different style (but all the royal styles are sort of the same)
- Manet (and others...), Salon of Rejects $\rightarrow$ they were rejected from the main salon,  so they went and created their own Salon!
  - "Art pompier" vs "art as pure aesthetic or transgressive practice"
- Manet "disrespected" a lot of rules of painting at the time
  - They did not paint stuff with an exact geometric perspective (which was a violation of Renaissance standards)
  - Choice of character is not historically accurate $\rightarrow$ note related to power or religion
  - Doesn't respect uses of colors (both in choice of colors + method of usage)/size of tables (idk wtf this means)!
- People thought that Manet was "grotesque" and a violation of traditional art forms
- **Conclusion:** We are still living in a system in which protocol is shaping the political life (positions are known by political competitors), displomatic protocols, etc.
  - Still there a lot of "diplomatic rules" that we have to follow
  - We can see this today as an extension of the court society $\rightarrow$ there are still long-term byproducts of the civilization process
  - A big focus on this "civilizing process"
