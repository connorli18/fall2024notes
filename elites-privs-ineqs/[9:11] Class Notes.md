# [9/11] Class Notes

#### Introduction

- Ternary Society $\rightarrow$ transition into a new model based on a new way to justify priviledge
  - Ternary $\rightarrow$ proprietarian society
- Norbert Elias (famous sociologist & author)  
  - Jewish merchant family (studied philosophy and medicine in Breslau)
  - Was at the intersection of 3 famous German sociologists at the time
  - His famous book is not about "The Court Society", it's about "The Civilization Process"
    - "Civility" is an attempt to define "good" behavior
    - Transnational process in Europe in 16th century $\rightarrow$ has to be understood!
- 16th century Europe $\rightarrow$ good manners originally were transmitted through oral tradition, but now, people are interested in "good manners" which is why books about good manners have audiences
  - How can I (not royalty) behave like the son of the king? 
  - If you can write the rule, then people can learn the rule (even if they are not insiders)
    - "You should use a tissue, and turn away from people while sneezing"
  - This is during a time of a decline of nobility/aristocracy and the rising Bourgzoise $\rightarrow$ now there are places for them to interact in Court Society
- 4 processes that are the pillars of this transformation: 
  - Territorial centralization: growing concentration of power (wars, marriages, etc.), building a kingdom with a continuous territory and regrouping more and more lords
    - Administrative form of power (money, armies, etc.) $\rightarrow$ rise of the modern state where the king can manage the whole territory and is in charge of building an administration
    - Differentiation of political and religious roles: (Westphalian Treaty 1648) - religious leadership and political leadership is different! 
  - Increasing specialization of administrative and political roles: Autonomy of the beauracracy (it's not tied to a family or anything else) $\rightarrow$ the winner will have the power of the federal state

#### Alastair Presentation: Court Society

- Court Society: Nobert Elias
- Purpose of the Research: we should focus on social positions instead of individuals, talked about developing the "royal position" and "royal powers"
  - How do we go from overthrown rulers to centralized powers that is more autonomous?
- What is Court Society?
  - House + Household of the King + his dependents (usually smaller, but expands as your power grows)
  - Advancement gained by having access to the court, which is difficult to gain (king gave most of the social positions including de-advancement)
- Development of Courts
  - The Catholic Church was the first to do something related to the "court"
  - France had a Princely Court $\rightarrow$ separated from religion, but the French Court society was the start of the fad where rulers manage the country through the courts
- Centralization of France
  - France started as a confederation of princes $\rightarrow$ royal power was limited and there was very little federal power
  - King was able to centralize power in Paris, royal lords now compete for places at the Royal court $\rightarrow$ instead of contesting the King's federal-ish power
- Elites of Court Society
  - "House prestige" is a defining feature, estates over economics $\rightarrow$ upkeep of the social standing, lifestyle, and standard of living defined their power!
  - Bourgeois society were not part of the court, but they could be "guests"/have a limited role,
  - Court Society Houses $\rightarrow$ very important to meetings, accomodations, social functions, and were very extravagant to impress people and show "high lifestyle"
- Role of Servants
  - The servants were very important because they would care for the elites $\rightarrow$ create the same standard of living for the elites and there was a very clear social hierarchy
