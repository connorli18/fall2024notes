#### Key Definitions

- States that are better at waging war will survive $\rightarrow$ nation-states prevail!
  - Why are nation-states better? They can legimitize these strategies!
    - Beauracracy to get money $\rightarrow$ people to go collect taxes in a more efficient way!
      - Furthermore, you make concessions to the upper-class in order to tax them more! 
    - How to prescript large armies very fast! $\rightarrow$ drafts, mandatory service, etc.
  - Modern states give use a more intense and intrusive/pervasive form of control/governing
    - Foucault says everything is a "prison" $\rightarrow$ unprecedented, new level of socialization (discipline without force to "fall in line")
- Habitus is an important terminology, definition is not complete 

#### Desert Civilization

- Desert and Sedentary civilization $\rightarrow$ shows how these interact and interlock with each other!
  - These civilizations can be like interestin culture/repeating social structure, beautiful oral/written traditions, etc.
- Desert civilization
  - Desert civilization is not what we would consider today's "civilization"
    - Based on pastoralism (transhumans, animal husbandry) or subsistence agriculture (no surplus)
    - Organized based on kinship; bedouins, steppe nomads (Mongols, Turkish), mountain villagers (Kurds, Pashtuns)
    - Interact with sedentary civilization through trade (that story of a village having to get salt) + migration (young men move for seasonal labor/cities)
  - Desert civilization economy
    - Low production diversity (no watches or uranium), low inequality (not basis of class differentiation) $\rightarrow$ higher status = more goat, less status = less goat
    - Surplus was invested in human relations (feasts, hospitality, gifts) $\rightarrow$ surplus is immediately redistributed
    - Low gender inequality too (everyone works, it seems very equal, domestic relations is really powerful)!
  - Society and Politics in Desert Civilization
    - Collective Retribution is a protective mechanism 
    - Asabiyya (collective impotence) $\rightarrow$ we all die, or non of us die
    - Weaknesses are small population + egalitarian spirit which makes centralization difficult
- Sedentary Civilization
  - Defining
    - Identification by residence and class $\rightarrow$ kinship ties atrophy when money is on the line
    - Hierarchical social divisions and seclusion of women!
  - Policies
    - Wealth, size, centralization are strengths
    - King is powerful!
    - Army is really professional (slave soldiers or mercenaries)
  - Weaknesses
