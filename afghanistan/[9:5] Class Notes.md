#### Afghanistan

##### Overview

- Afghanistan has some very fertile land, with snow-fed rivers!
  - Rivers are not necessarily navigable, and they don't have as much water as the other famous rivers in the Middle East
  - Also make things agrable, they are very important for farming and food production
- Most settlement is around the river basins, this has implications for policy and settlement patterns

##### Geography, Inhabitants

- Everything is done at village autonomy (each village should be able to feed itself), doesn't produce a surplus but it feeds reliably the population that is dependent on it
- Every region has one main town, and every region is part of one main river-basin (this town serves as "the seed of the region")
  - These towns serve administrative and market locations on certain days of the week
- Also, there is a sizable population of nomads 
- **Longue Durée** (Braudel): Over centuries analysis of human life (example is that centuries we went without modern medicine), social-political structure and settlement patterns stayed the same for centrues in Afghanistan
  - (Things that stayed the same in Afghanistan) What people farmed, tools people had, space+time to get from end-to-end in Afghanistan

##### Regions in Afghanistan

- Regions

  - Balkh and the north

  - Kandahar and the south

  - Herat and the west

  - Kabul and the East

- The regions don't seem to make a lot of sense, but they have geographical and historical significance (cultural similiarties over the long-durée)

  - Mountains are in the middle $\rightarrow$ so you need to understand the immense geographic barriers that are associated with this stuff

##### Key Definitions

- **How power justifies itself:** Traditional, Charismatic, Legal-Rational
  - Traditional: My father was the king, and I am the rightful king
  - Charismatic: I have shown my capability in period of crisis, so I should be king
  - Legal-Rational: My application of power is legitmate because it is legal!
- <u>Administrative apparatus</u> $\rightarrow$ monopoly of legitimate force/violence in a certain territory
- <u>Concentration</u> $\rightarrow$ getting everyone's resources under your own, for the state legimitamacy (gangsters where you pay "protection fees")
  - You can consider the state as a stationary bandit $\rightarrow$ this is taxation!
  - This also reinforces the "chain of delegation", enlarging the administrative appartus
- <u>Differentiation</u> $\rightarrow$ class divisions, very clear distinctions between groups of individuals
- <u>Rationalization</u> $\rightarrow$ (example) transition away from aristocrats dominating in army as generals, criteria for selection is now competence instead of birth right!
- <u>Nation and its historicity</u> $\rightarrow$ State comes first, and then they create the nation (sometimes by very violence tactics), the state imposes various things on the population
  - You can go to state school and come out a French-speaking citizen, army and conscription (inbued with national culuture)
  - Oftentimes, it's the elites of the apparatus that construct the nation $\rightarrow$ state calendars organize time, national wars, existential survival (this solidarity did not exist before the modern states)
    - Turks, Mongols, Muslims all conquered it!
  - A successful construction is one where you forgot how it was created in the first place!
- <u>Tilly</u> $\rightarrow$ "War makes states and states make war"
  - Interstate warfare in Europe inspired this argument; all of them converged on territorial, administrative, etc.
    - In order to survive, you have to be good at warfare $\rightarrow$ you basically have to be a conscription model of society in order to survive in European constant warfare
    - Develop an administrative, fiscal apparatus (in charge of taxes) and people need to be in charge with competence with legal and administrative skills
  -
